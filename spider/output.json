{"text": "Donald Trump, who famously called himself the \"king of debt,\" may have ironically brought about the end of Wall Street's golden age in debt. Societe Generale warned investors this week that the decade-long party in the debt markets \"is over.\" Borrowing costs are poised to rise rapidly, hurting the economy and fueling a stampede out of debt funds more powerful than what markets expect.  \"Prepare for a serious hangover,\" SocGen wrote in a report on Monday.  An \"unprecedented build-up of debt\" over the past decade will likely worsen the pain and make any bond selloff \"more dangerous,\" the firm said.  Already, there are signs that the music has stopped in this popular corner of the markets.  Trump's election and plans to stimulate the American economy by borrowing money has fueled a massive bet on stronger growth and more inflation. When that happens, investors tend to dump boring bonds in favor of risky stocks.  While stocks have soared to record highs, behind the scenes there's been a \"violent\" wave of selling in the bond markets, bumping up borrowing costs. The 10-year Treasury yield has skyrocketed to 2.34%, compared with 1.85% on Election Day. It's increased the price of other forms of credit, including mortgages.  Related: 2 powerful market forces could hurt Trump's plans  Bank of America Merrill Lynch called it a \"stampede\" out of bond funds. Investors yanked $18 billion out of bond funds in the week after the election, the most dramatic outflow in 3.5 years.  Trump's \"unanticipated rise\" has let some of the air out of the \"bond market bubble,\" S&P Global wrote in a report on Tuesday.  Some believe the post-election rush out of bonds and into stocks may be overdone and due for a reversal. That may be true. After all, the end of the bond bubble has been wrongly called many times in recent years.  But here's why SocGen thinks this is just the beginning of a larger \"unwinding.\"  Growth pick-up: Even before Trump's election, the economy appears to have gathered momentum. The U.S. economy grew at a healthy 3.2% in the third quarter, the best pace in two years. Wall Street thinks the economy could grow even faster given Trump's promises to provide stimulus by cutting taxes and ramping up infrastructure.  Central banks take a back seat: Fiscal stimulus may allow the Federal Reserve and other central banks to ease off the emergency steps that had been keeping rates super low. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates in December for the second time since 2007. However, expectations are that the momentum on rate increases will only pick up next year.  Inflation showing signs of life: SocGen said inflation is \"bottoming out,\" a trend that should hurt demand for debt and allow central banks to further raise interest rates. For instance, U.S. wages grew in October by the fastest since June 2009.   Adding to American debt: Trump's planned tax cuts and infrastructure spending may \"substantially raise the deficit,\" SocGen said. Trump's fiscal proposals will cause the U.S. debt to soar to 105% of GDP by 2026, compared with nearly 77% today, according to estimates from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.   Sign up for CNNMoney's morning market newsletter: Before The Bell  If the debt party is truly over, the consequences could be massive for global financial markets.  Obviously, this would be bad news for bond funds, which have become very popular during the recent boom. Keep in mind that the market value of investment grade bonds tracked by Barclays Global Aggregate Fund has doubled over the past decade to a stunning $45 trillion, according to SocGen.  Performance in large bond funds is already \"fast deteriorating\" and losses and withdrawals will only continue if rates keep rising, SocGen predicted.  But bond investors are no different than the people who invest in the stock market. That means the pain in bonds could force selling that spills over into the broader markets.  Even after the recent turmoil, rates remain very low. But if they continue to rise, that could hurt the economy by translating to higher borrowing costs. Already, mortgage rates have risen significantly, making it more expensive to buy a home. This powerful force could make Trump's plans for an economic boom more difficult to achieve.   Likewise, higher rates translates to elusive credit for companies without the perfect balance sheets of Apple (AAPL, Tech30). Recall that the shale oil revolution that has transformed the global energy landscape was partially fueled by easy credit.  Another potential consequence: trouble for emerging markets. That's because the recent debt turmoil has coincided with a stronger U.S. dollar, which makes it harder for overseas borrowers to pay back dollar-denominated debt. SocGen estimates that dollar-denominated credit overseas has doubled to nearly $10 trillion over the past decade, especially in emerging markets.

{"text": "In the three weeks since Election Day, the news media has fallen into a familiar routine. Donald Trump fires off a tweet and reporters scramble to file stories about it. The pattern has caused some to wonder if the tweets are a deliberate distraction by Trump.  But it appears that, at times, Trump may be behaving like so many other Twitter users and simply responding emotionally to what he's watching on television. In at least six instances since Election Day, the subject of Trump's tweets has pertained to a segment that had just aired on TV.  On Tuesday morning, seemingly out of nowhere, Trump took to Twitter to express his staunch opposition to burning the American flag. Incineration of Old Glory, Trump tweeted shortly before 7 a.m. ET, should be met with either \"loss of citizenship or year in jail!\"   Flag burning hasn't drawn much recent attention in American politics. But it was brought up on Fox News on Tuesday morning.  Roughly 30 minutes before Trump's tweet, the channel's morning show, \"Fox & Friends\" -- on which Trump had long been a regular guest -- ran a segment about a protest at a Massachusetts college over the school's decision to stop flying all flags after students allegedly burned an American flag to protest Trump's victory. (A reporter for ABC News first noted the timing of the segment.)  It's possible Trump was motivated to take a stand on flag burning for other reasons; his spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond to a request for comment  But it wouldn't have been the first time that Trump, an avid cable news consumer, reacted in real-time to something he watched on Fox News, MSNBC or CNN.  On Monday night at 9:05 p.m. ET, CNN aired a report by correspondent Jeff Zeleny refuting Trump's baseless claim that there were \"millions\" of illegal votes cast in the election. By 9:14 p.m. ET, Trump was retweeting supporters who had maligned Zeleny and CNN.  On the morning of November 13, Trump claimed in a tweet that the New York Times \"is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'Trump phenomena.'\"   A half hour before Trump sent that tweet, \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" ran a segment regarding an email that Times' publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and executive editor Dean Baquet sent to subscribers in which they reflected on the newspaper's coverage of Trump. Nowhere in the email did Sulzberger and Baquet mention losing subscribers -- and the Times has since touted a significant increase in subscribers -- but the segment included a suggestion that the paper is taking a hit.  \"You know what they suffer from? Their bottom line. Their business they got to make money, and they're not making it. They've been hearing from their readers,\" Fox News contributor Pete Hegseth said.   Two days later, a week after his win in the Electoral College, Trump tweeted that he would would have \"easily\" triumphed if the election were decided by popular vote. \"Fox & Friends\" had held a panel discussion about anti-Trump protests that touched on Hillary Clinton's edge in the popular vote an hour before.  This past Saturday night, Trump was irked again by questions surrounding the vote tally, tweeting that the recount effort led by Green Party nominee Jill Stein was a \"scam\" that \"is now being joined by the badly defeated & demoralized Dems.\"  Minutes before that tweet, Fox News had reported on-air on the Clinton campaign joining the recount in three states.  Related: News media struggles to cover Trump's tweets and falsehoods  The journalism world is still figuring out how to cover the new president-elect, who feuds and tweets far more than most other elected officials -- much less occupants of the White House. As editors contemplate whether his tweets are worth reporting, Trump is already challenging the idea that everything a president does is newsworthy and deserving of coverage.  Not all of Trump's tweets are quite so confrontational or controversial. He has also used the platform to extend the occasional conciliatory gesture, as he did on the morning on November 20, when he tweeted kind words about the newly elected Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer. The tweet went out to Trump's millions of followers as a pre-taped interview with Schumer aired on NBC's \"Meet The Press.\"  Moments after the interview ended, \"Meet the Press\" co-host Chuck Todd was reading Trump's tweet on air.

{"text": "Tiffany, the iconic jewelry retailer, said on Tuesday that sales in the U.S. were hurt by all the chaos surrounding its flagship store on New York City's 5th Avenue, which just so happens to be neighbors with Trump Tower. While Tiffany didn't mention the President-elect by name, it was clear what Tiffany was referring to when it said that there has been \"some adverse effect on traffic\" at the 5th Avenue location due to \"the impact of recent election-related activity.\"  Tiffany added that there was \"softness\" at this store and warned that sales could be hit again in the fourth quarter. The 5th Avenue store accounts for close to 10% of the company's total sales.  Overall sales for Tiffany's U.S. and other North American stores in its most recent quarter fell 2% from a year ago.  Security has been heightened on 5th Avenue since the election. There have been some protests outside Trump Tower. But much of the police activity is due to the fact that Donald Trump lives in Trump Tower and has been holed up there since the election.  Tiffany CFO Mark Erceg added during a conference call that there were \"minor disruptions to pedestrian foot traffic\" around the 5th Avenue store and that Tiffany was \"understandably cautious as to how the situation might impact sales over the coming weeks.\"  But it's not all bad news for Tiffany. Sales in China and Japan were strong, helping to lead to a slight increase in overall revenue for the company. It's the first time Tiffany's quarterly sales rose since November 2014.  Related: Protecting Donald Trump costs NYC more than $1 million a day  Tiffany CEO Frederic Cumenal said in a press release that the company was \"encouraged by some early signs of improvement in sales trends.\"  Investors chose to focus on that instead of the weakness in the Big Apple. Shares of Tiffany (TIF) rose 5% in early trading on the news.  Like most retailers, the holidays tend to be a busy time for Tiffany. And the company reaffirmed its outlook for the fourth quarter, a sign that it does not expect any further weakness at its flagship store to drag down results for the whole company.  Nonetheless, it's a tumultuous time in the jewelry business -- putting aside all the election-related madness. Tiffany's competitor Signet (SIG), which owns discount jewelry brands Kay, Jared and Zales, has been accused of selling fake diamonds.  And online jeweler Blue Nile (NILE) is in the process of being taken private by a group led by Bain Capital.  Bain is the private equity firm co-founded by Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who is rumored to be a contender for Secretary of State in Trump's administration.  So all things considered, Tiffany is actually holding up relatively well -- despite a continued police presence in New York that threatens to keep tourists and other shoppers away from 5th Avenue.

{"text": "Donald Trump has put OPEC on notice. As OPEC meets Wednesday in Vienna, this could be one of its last chances to assert its power before Trump takes office.  \"This is really OPEC's last hurrah to have a real impact on the global market. When Trump comes in, it will be tougher to control prices,\" says Phil Flynn, senior energy analyst at PRICE Futures Group in Chicago.  Trump has been clear that he wants America to be an even bigger energy power player on the world stage. The more oil the U.S. pumps, the less clout OPEC has to hike prices like it did during the infamous 1973 embargo.  \"I've never understood why, with all of our own reserves, we've allowed this country to be held hostage by OPEC, the cartel of oil-producing countries, some of which are hostile to America,\" Trump wrote in his book \"Crippled America.\"  This week Saudi Arabia, Iran and other members of the OPEC cartel are debating whether to raise oil prices by cutting -- or at least freezing -- production.  \"If they miss this opportunity, they are not going to get another opportunity like this for a decade,\" predicts Flynn.  Related: Saudis believe Trump will unleash America's economy  The Saudis want a deal  Crude oil trades at about $45 a barrel. If OPEC fails to reach a deal Wednesday, it could easily plummet to $40 or below. If it does take action, prices will likely \"test their 2016 highs\" of $51.90 a barrel, says Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst at Forex.com  \"I think a deal is more likely to happen now than ever before,\" says Havar Blakset, a partner at Rystad Energy, an independent oil and gas consulting firm. He notes that Saudi Arabia is still OPEC's key player and this time around, the Saudis are the ones trying to drive the deal.  Saudi Arabia (and most energy producing nations) have been severely hurt by two years of extremely low oil prices. The Saudi government ran a deficit of nearly $100 billion last year. It even had to raise gas prices on its own people by 50%.  Many believe the Saudis intentionally kept prices down to try to run U.S. shale oil companies out of business, but the U.S. energy industry has remained remarkably resilient. The U.S. is on track to be energy independent by 2020 in a best case scenario.  Related: U.S. energy independence looks 'tantalizingly close'  Trump's wants 'energy revolution'  Trump wants to speed that time table up. In his first 100 days, he pledges to \"lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion worth of job-producing American energy reserves.\" Translation: He wants more U.S. energy production. Fast.  To achieve his promised \"energy revolution,\" Trump intends to open federal lands onshore and offshore to drilling and roll back President Obama's environmental restrictions on energy production. Even more worrying to OPEC is Trump's vow -- right on his website -- to stop importing energy from OPEC nations.  When Trump takes office, OPEC is \"not going to be able to pull the same shenanigans with price and production wars,\" says Flynn.  Related: Trumponomics suddenly gets big Wall Street thumbs up  OPEC vs. Trump  The stakes are high for OPEC Wednesday to show it still has the ability to act decisively.  \"Our best case scenario is that there would be a deal. But how big is it? And does it have meaningful impact?\" says Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets in London.  Then there's the question of whether Saudi Arabia, Iran and others will even hold to a deal if they sign one.  For Trump, whatever OPEC does Wednesday probably doesn't matter much, if at all, argues Aslam. Publicly, the Saudis have said they think Trump will be good for the U.S. economy, which should translate into more demand for oil.  In a way, Trump \"wins\" if the nations agree to a deal because oil prices will rise. That will incentivize U.S. shale oil producers to drill and pump more oil. It may even help bring back some of the 200,00 jobs that have been lost in the energy sectors since oil prices really started to plummet in the fall of 2014.  But Trump also benefits if there is no deal because it keeps gas prices at the pump extremely low because that will help the economy as he's sworn in. That's a boost to consumers and businesses and it helps keep inflation in check. Trump's various plans for tax cuts and more infrastructure spending are likely to drive inflation higher.

{"text": "President-elect Donald Trump fired off a series of tweets late Monday and early Tuesday criticizing CNN for reporting that his claims about voter fraud are baseless -- which they are. Shortly after 9 p.m., Trump began retweeting supporters who had criticized CNN's Jeff Zeleny because he accurately reported that there was no evidence -- nor has the transition team provided any-- to support Trump's claim that millions of fraudulent votes had been cast for Hillary Clinton.  \"[W]hat PROOF do u have DonaldTrump did not suffer from millions of FRAUD votes? Journalist? Do your job!\" read the first post that Trump retweeted. \"Just another generic CNN part time wannabe journalist!,\" read the second.  \"@CNN still doesn't get it,\" Trump added. \"They will never learn!\"  One post Trump retweeted came from a Twitter user whose bio says he's 16, who, like the others, called Zeleny a \"bad reporter\" because he did not have evidence that Trump was not a victim of voter fraud, a double-negative reasoning used to defend many conspiracy theories.  Finally, Trump issued his own attack on CNN: \".@CNN is so embarrassed by their total (100%) support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don't know what to do,\" he wrote.  He continued the attack in a tweet just after 6:30 a.m. Tuesday: \"I thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse!\"  A CNN spokesperson declined to comment. Zeleny responded to Trump with a request for examples of the fraud.  \"@realDonaldTrump Good evening! Have been looking for examples of voter fraud. Please send our way.

{"text": "President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who profited from the housing meltdown, as his Treasury secretary, according to an official briefed on the decision. Mnuchin's career has been full of contradictions. He started as a Wall Street insider working for old-line firms before running a series of eclectic businesses -- including his own hedge fund and a West Coast consumer bank. In recent years, he has been a Hollywood movie producer.  He served as finance chairman of Trump's presidential campaign and has been one of Trump's closest economic advisers. His nomination will be announced as soon as Wednesday, the official said.  As Treasury secretary, the 53-year-old Mnuchin would be the face of the American economy around the world. The Treasury Department has expansive responsibility over business and oversees banking regulations, financial markets and the IRS. It has about 100,000 employees, an estimated 91,000 of them at the IRS.  Besides co-signing the currency, the Treasury secretary is Uncle Sam's banker -- paying the bills, collecting taxes, managing the federal government debt and selling billions of dollars a year in Treasury bonds.  Mnuchin, like his father before him, was a partner at Goldman. He worked for the firm for 17 years, joining at age 22 and leaving just before his 40th birthday, in 2002.  He briefly joined the hedge fund of his former college roommate Eddie Lampert. Mnuchin still serves as a director of Sears Holdings (SHLD), of which Lampert is chairman and CEO.  After less than a year, he left Lampert to work as a portfolio manager for the hedge fund of George Soros, the billionaire financier who has bankrolled liberal candidates and causes -- and who was depicted as a villain in Trump's last campaign ad.  He only stayed a year, leaving in September 2004 to start his own hedge fund, Dune Capital Management.  As a producer, he has put out films including \"American Sniper,\" \"The Lego Movie\" and this summer's \"Suicide Squad.\" His latest film, which opened right before Thanksgiving, is called \"Rules Don't Apply.\"  Mnuchin joined the Trump campaign as finance chairman in May, and sources tell CNN he made it clear early that he wanted the Treasury job. He recruited deputies before he was tapped for the job.  Mnuchin has contributed to both Republican and Democratic candidates, including Hillary Clinton's Senate campaigns and 2008 presidential run. He gave to Barack Obama's Senate and presidential campaigns and to Charles Schumer, the new Democratic leader in the Senate.   Mnuchin and his brother were sued by the trustee trying to recover money for Bernard Madoff's victims after his Ponzi scheme unraveled in 2008. They were executors of their mother's estate, and had withdrawn her investment with Madoff shortly after she died in 2005.  A court eventually blocked the trustee, Irving Picard, from collecting Mnuchin's mother's $3.2 million in profits withdrawn from the Madoff fund long before its collapse.  Mnuchin led the group that bought failed subprime lender IndyMac for pennies on the dollar in 2009, about a year after the FDIC took over the California bank following a run on deposits by customers.  IndyMac had become a poster child for the risky home loans that brought on the housing crisis and the meltdown in financial markets. The FDIC agreed to assume much of the losses as part of its sale to Mnuchin, who renamed it OneWest.  But regulators soon questioned OneWest's foreclosure practices, which included so-called robo-signings that pushed homeowners into foreclosure without proper review or due process.  The bank was one of many that agreed to pay millions in fines to compensate customers. Occupy Los Angeles protesters showed up at Mnuchin's Bel Air mansion. And this month, two fair housing groups in California filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, accusing the bank of discriminating against minority borrowers during his tenure there.  Mnuchin eventually sold OneWest to CIT Group (CIT) in 2014 for $3.4 billion and joined CIT as part of the deal. When he left CIT less than two years later, he received a $10.9 million severance package.

{"text": "America's economy stayed on track before the U.S. election. The economy added 161,000 jobs in October, a solid gain, suggesting it is maintaining its healthy and steady pace.  Jobs added during the previous month were also revised up substantially by the Labor Department. It is the last look at the health of the economy for Americans voters before they cast their ballots next week.  Unemployment fell a tick to 4.9%. That's down by half since 2009, when unemployment peaked at 10%.  October's gains marked the 73rd consecutive month of job gains for the U.S. economy.  \"We see so many examples in our data of an economy moving in the right direction,\" U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez told CNNMoney.  The September job gains were revised up to 191,000 jobs from the first read of 156,000.  Wage growth -- one of the last metrics to move in the right direction post-recession -- continued to show signs of accelerating. Wages grew 2.8% in October compared to a year ago, the fastest growth since June 2009.  \"We're going to see stronger wage growth going forward as we see a labor market that's approaching full employment,\" says Jacob Duritsky, vice president at Team NEO, a nonprofit that focuses on economic development in northeast Ohio.  Sign up for CNNMoney's morning market newsletter: Before The Bell  The jobs report has become a divisive subject in the presidential election. Donald Trump has called the official unemployment rate a \"hoax\" and he's tried to discredit the Labor Department's official numbers.  Trump says the unemployment rate is closer to 10%, using a broader measure of unemployment, which also counts some part time workers as unemployed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a wing of the Labor Department, has never relied on this measure to describe the country's key unemployment rate.  \"it's absurd to argue that the Bureau of Labor Statistics is shading the numbers in some way,\" says Robert Murphy, a professor at Boston College and former economist on the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. The BLS \"has high integrity.\"  Trump campaign said in a statement that it was a \"disastrous jobs report.\" He criticized the economy's performance during President Obama's tenure. He also noted the high poverty levels among young black Americans.  Overall, the black unemployment rate at the end of October stood at 8.6%, down from a peak of 16.6% in 2010.  Both candidates have promised to spend more on building new roads and bridges. Hillary Clinton wants to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers, and Trump has proposed tax cuts and slashing business regulations. Clinton would add more jobs than Trump, according to analysis of both their policies by Moody's, Oxford Economics and UPenn's Wharton School Budget Model.  Related: U.S. economy posts best growth in two years   The solid job numbers on Friday come one week after America posted its best quarterly economic growth in two years of 2.9%. Overall, though, growth has been sluggish in the years since the Great Recession, and that trend has been a major issue on the campaign trail.  The job market is not free of problems either. There remain a high number of discouraged workers -- people who haven't been able to find jobs in the past year and have given up the hunt. And there's about six million Americans working part-time jobs who want full-time jobs. These trends are near the top of the worry list for policy makers.  The strong wage growth in October is a long-awaited and welcome sign for many workers. Stagnant wages have been a major reason why many Americans didn't feel the benefits of the recovery over the last seven years.  Solid job gains and wage growth also helps to clear the path for the Federal Reserve to raise rates at its next meeting in December. That would be a sign that America's economy is getting closer to full health.  \"This will provide comfort to those at the Fed who are ready to increase the federal funds rate,\" says Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, an accounting firm in New York.

The bottom line is that the Model S is fun to drive, with great handling and amazing acceleration, but it also suffers from more than its share of annoying technical glitches, according to the magazine.  About 1,400 Tesla owners surveyed complained of problems with the car's charging equipment, center console area and things like door and windows. They also had issues with the car's electric drive systems and they complained about rattles, squeaks and leaks in the sunroof.  Tesla shares slid 10% shortly after Consumer Reports released the survey.  Gallery: 10 most reliable car brands  The Tesla Model S had been Consumer Reports overall \"Top Pick\" among all cars for the last two model years -- its ultimate recommendation. But in order to be considered for a Top Pick, a car must have a reliability rating of at least average.  The magazine reached out to Tesla for its response to the survey results.  \"Close communication with our customers enables Tesla to receive input, proactively address issues, and quickly fix problems,\" the California-based automaker told Consumer Reports. \"Model S over-the-air software updates allow Tesla to diagnose and fix most bugs without the need to come in for service.\"  Consumer Reports surveyed owners of more than 740,000 vehicles about their experiences with their cars, trucks and SUVs and used those responses to predict future reliability for more than two dozen brands.  Detroit-based car brands also did not fare well in the survey. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAM) scored especially poorly. Its Fiat, Jeep and Ram brands ranked at the very bottom of a list of 28 different car brands. Dodge and Chrysler were also among the bottom 10.  Two big areas of trouble for many of the cars were so-called \"infotainment\" systems -- computer interfaces that control things like entertainment, navigation and mobile phone connections -- and complex new fuel-saving transmissions.  Only General Motors (GM)' Buick made it into the magazine's Top 10 for reliability. Lexus and Toyota (TM), both long known for dependability, took the top two slots.

{"text": "You could soon be driving like a Queen. No, really. Cars once owned by the royal family are going up for auction soon and bidding has already started. The cars for sale include two used by Queen Elizabeth, an Audi used by Princess Diana and a Rolls-Royce once owned by Princess Margaret. All the cars are being sold by a British real estate agent who built his collection of a dozen cars in just five years, and is now selling them all off at once.  One of the cars on the block is a 2012 Bentley Mulsanne, the top-of-the-line model from the British ultra-luxury carmaker. This particular Mulsanne was formerly the \"personal conveyance\" of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and was custom built for that job. It was fitted with special flashing lights hidden behind the grill and even has the royal crest in the interior wood trim.  When the queen was finished with it, the car was returned to Bentley and evidence of its previous ownership was scrubbed, including the royal crest. But the next owner noticed that the home address in the car's GPS was Windsor Castle, which spurred him to investigate and learn that the Queen was the car's original owner.  Ian Lillicrap, who now owns all of these cars, bought the Bentley from that owner. Today it has just under 6,000 miles on its odometer and is worth between \u00a3215,000 to \u00a3235,000 or $262,000 to $286,000.  The royal carsare all part of Lillicrap's 12 car collection which he's selling because, he says, he's having work done on his house that he's afraid will damage the underground garage where they're kept.  \"I have a feeling I will rue the day I let all 12 of these go,\" Lillicrap said.  One of Lillicrap's other cars is a 2001 Daimler Super V8 that was also used as the Queen's personal car. Britain's Daimler, which is no relation to the German maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, was an ultra-luxury division of Jaguar cars. This particular car has even been featured in the Jaguar museum. The Queen and her husband Prince Philip were chauffeured in this car, but they also frequently drove it themselves. It was even fitted with a special storage compartment in which the Queen could put her handbag while driving.  Special security features in the Queen's Daimler include a place in the trunk to mount radios for a direct connection to the Home Office and 10 Downing Street. (The radio equipment itself is no longer there.) The car is painted, appropriately, in British Racing Green and is valued at \u00a350,000 to \u00a360,00.  Also available is a 1994 Audi A4 Cabriolet formerly used by Princess Diana after she and Prince Charles separated. She never owned the car, instead it was provided for her use by an Audi dealership. After it was returned by Diana, the car had two more owners, but it still has only 21,400 miles on it. It's valued at \u00a350,000 to \u00a360,000 or $61,000 to $73,000.  The collection also includes a 1980 Silver Wraith II formerly used by Princess Margaret. That car also includes a number of customizations done to suit the princess.  Silverstone auctions will sell the cars at a live auction on Nov. 12 in England but on-line bidding is already open at Proxibid.com. Bids made on-line will ultimately compete against bids placed live at the event and over telephones on the day of the auction.

{"text": "The Falcon Wing doors are without a doubt the coolest-looking part of Tesla's new Model X crossover SUV. And they're actually even cooler than they look. These doors sense and react to their surroundings. The Falcon Wing doors are hinged at the top, like the more familiar gullwing doors found on those classic Mercedes-Benz sports cars. But each of the Tesla (TSLA) doors has a second hinge that creates something like an elbow. That allows the doors to open in different ways depending on the situation.  The simplest and fastest way for these doors to open is up and out, like the Mercedes doors do.  But Tesla's elbow means that Model X drivers can park anywhere -- even in tight spaces.  Related: Tesla's new Model X will cost you  The Falcon Wing doors are equipped with sensors that can tell if there is something next to or above them. So if if there's a car parked right next to the Model X the top part of the door will swing up but, at the same time, the elbow will bend in. That way the bottom part of the door that runs parallel to the side of the car will be pulled almost straight up without hitting anything.  If the car is parked somewhere with a low ceiling, say a garage, the doors will go up as far as they can, then the elbows will bend out to make enough room for people to get in or out.  Tesla's ultrasonic sensors bounce high-pitched sound waves (that can't be detected by the human ear) off of objects around the vehicle to detect anything that might get in the way.  The designers wanted to preserve the smooth skin of the SUV, so the company figured out a way to do all of this without having any sensors visible on the outside of the car.  Tesla engineers invented sensors that could \"see\" through aluminum sheet metal, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said, so that they can be hidden inside the doors. Musk admitted that the Model X's incredible complexity had been a challenge in getting it ready for production.  Photos - Bentley's new SUV: Bentayga  And sensors can also see inside the door, not just outside of it. So if a Falcon Wing door is closing and there's an arm or a leg in the way it will stop moving.  Tesla engineers didn't just study science to make all this work, though. Musk said he wanted the doors' movements as graceful as possible  \"Actually, I had the engineers watch ballet,\" he said.  Hopefully, the dance will impress the 25,000 buyers who ordered a Model X before even seeing it.

{"text": "Protecting President-elect Donald Trump and his family is costing New York City more than $1 million a day, according to three city officials. And those costs won't necessarily drop significantly once he moves to the White House.  That's because Melania Trump and their 10-year old son Barron expect to stay at their home at Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan, at least until the end of the school year. And Donald Trump has indicated he plans to return home regularly, especially while they're still here.  Adding to the expense is the cost of police assigned to Trump's adult children and his grandchildren, who are also receiving Secret Service protection, John Miller, NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence & counterterrorism, told WCBS Monday. All of them live in the city, and all are entitled to receive Secret Service protection.  \"The number one imperative here is safety and security. We owe that to the president elect, his family and his team,\" said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio at a press conference on Friday. But he added the city will need help with those costs, particularly police overtime.  \"This is a very substantial undertaking. It will take substantial resources,\" he said. \"We will begin the conversation with the federal government shortly on reimbursement for the NYPD for some of the costs that we are incurring.\"  While primary responsibility for the protection of the president, or president-elect, rests with the Secret Service, local law enforcement is charged with assisting them, particularly in controlling movements of the general public.  Related: Top network executives, anchors meet with Trump  Every president is required to have local law enforcement protection when they return home during their terms. But protecting Trump in New York City is particularly costly, given that he lives in the most densely-populated neighborhood of the nation's biggest city.  \"We have never had a situation where a POTUS (president of the United States) would be here on such a regular basis,\" said de Blasio. \"The details of his future plans are unknown, but we certainly know over these next 65 days [until the inauguration] he will be here regularly. The NYPD is up to the challenge and the city of New York is up to the challenge, I have no doubt about that.\"  Related: Donald Trump says SNL was 'biased' and asks for 'equal time'  The city has sought and received reimbursement for protecting world leaders in the past, such as when heads of state visit the United Nations, de Blasio said. City records show it received $26 million in reimbursements for such expenses in the 12 months ending June 30, or about $500,000 a week. But the fact that the city will need to protect Trump on an ongoing basis is unprecedented, de Blasio said.  \"This makes [previous protection efforts] look quite small obviously,\" he said. \"We'll have to establish a new set of ground rules.\"  The police have set up barricades around Trump Tower at 56th Street and 5th Avenue, smack in the middle of the city. While a block of 56th street has basically been closed to traffic, 5th Avenue remains open, although the traffic flow on that major thoroughfare has been affected.  And as Trump moves through the city, police need to close streets accordingly. For example, the Lincoln Tunnel was closed to traffic on Friday afternoon during rush hour when Trump traveled to New Jersey.

A change to the country's income tax laws pushed through parliament Tuesday requires hoarders of untaxed income to hand over 50% when they disclose it to the government.

{"text": "President-elect Donald Trump says he plans to nominate Georgia Representative Tom Price, an ardent critic of Obamacare, to head the Department of Health and Human Services. In a statement early Tuesday, Trump called Price \"exceptionally qualified to shepherd our commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare and bring affordable and accessible healthcare to every American.\"  Trump also named Seema Verma, a health care consultant who designed Indiana's Medicaid program, as the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The agency administers Obamacare.  One of Price's top priorities as health secretary will be to dismantle the sweeping health reform law that his two predecessors spent six years implementing.  \"There is much work to be done to ensure we have a healthcare system that works for patients, families, and doctors,\" Price, an orthopedic surgeon, said in the statement.  Price, who chairs the House Budget Committee, has long decried Obamacare as a threat to quality and affordable health care.  Related: Obamacare under President Trump: What happens next?  \"The purpose of health reform should be to advance accessibility, affordability, quality, responsiveness, and innovation,\" the Republican congressman said in 2011, a year after Obamacare was signed into law. \"None of these are improved\" by the Affordable Care Act, he added.  The nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate. Democrats were quick to attack it.  \"Congressman Price has proven to be far out of the mainstream of what Americans want when it comes to Medicare, the Affordable Care Act, and Planned Parenthood,\" said Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic leader in the Senate.  \"Thanks to those three programs, millions of American seniors, families, people with disabilities and women have access to quality, affordable health care. Nominating Congressman Price to be the HHS secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house.\"  Before entering politics, Price spent nearly 20 years in private practice as an orthopedic surgeon. He also served as medical director of the orthopedic clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital and as an assistant professor at Emory University's School of Medicine  Price then spent four terms in the Georgia State Senate. In 2004, he was elected to the House of Representatives. He was named Budget Committee chair in 2015.  Related: Americans are freaking out about losing Obamacare  Price has authored several iterations of an Obamacare replacement plan, which bears many similarities to Trump's vision for health care reform and to House Speaker Paul Ryan's overhaul proposal. Price's most recent bill, The Empowering Patients First Act of 2015, calls for giving refundable tax credits to those who buy policies in the individual market. The credits would be adjusted by age, ranging from $1,200 for those age 18 to 35 to $3,000 for those age 50 and up.  Related: Major changes for Medicaid coming under Trump and the GOP  The plan would also offer more incentives for Americans to use Health Savings Accounts, including a one-time $1,000 tax credit for making contributions. It caps the tax exclusion on employer-sponsored plans at $20,000 for family coverage, and it allows insurers to sell coverage across state lines. Price's bill also pushes states to create high-risk pools to insure those rejected by carriers on the individual market -- usually those who have costly, pre-existing conditions.  Related: How Trump may cover Americans with pre-existing conditions  Also, it limits using federal funds to pay for abortions and protects health care providers who don't want to perform abortions for religious reasons.  More recently, Price has touted Ryan's health care plan, titled \"A Better Way.\"  \"It's time for a better way to put patients, families, and doctors back in charge of medical decisions,\" Price said in October. \"President Obama and Democrats must put their pride and politics aside so that we can start over with a Better Way\u2014a step-by-step plan to give every American access to quality, affordable health care.\"  Ryan called Price \"the absolute perfect choice.\"  Related: Entrepreneurs to Trump: Don't take away our Obamacare  \"As a legislator, he has played a leading role in developing conservative health care solutions that put patients first,\" the House speaker said in a statement.  Price also supports using the budget reconciliation process -- which allows Congress to approve provisions that affect federal revenues and spending with a simple majority instead of 60 votes -- to overhaul health care and entitlements, including Medicare, in 2017.  As Health Secretary, Price also would oversee Medicare, which provides health insurance to more than 57 million senior citizens and disabled Americans. Ryan's \"A Better Way\" plan calls for giving enrollees premium support payments, or subsidies, to cover or offset the cost of their Medicare premiums. Critics are concerned that this would leave Medicare participants footing more of the bill.  Verma is the founder of SVC, a health policy consulting company. She was worked with governors and states on Medicaid, insurance and public health projects for more than 20 years. She led Indiana's health reform effort under former Governor Mitch Daniels.  In announcing Verma, Trump noted that she has had \"extensive experience redesigning Medicaid programs in several states.\" She served as the architect of Indiana's Medicaid program and its expansion effort under Governor Mike Pence, who is the vice president-elect.  Pence agreed to expand Medicaid and even offer participants the option of limited dental and vision benefits. But, in return, enrollees must make monthly contributions of 2% of their annual household income to an account similar to a health savings account. Hoosiers who elect basic Medicaid coverage face co-pays, which could range from $4 to $8 per doctor visit or prescription and could run as high as $75 for each hospital stay.  Related: Major changes for Medicaid coming under Trump and the GOP  Trump will likely lean heavily on his health secretary to replace Obamacare.  \"This pick is quite consistent with President-Elect Trump's commitment to repeal the Affordable Care Act,\" said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"Tom Price has been a consistent foe of the ACA. And he knows the ins and outs of how Congress works, which could prove important as we enter another big legislative debate over the future of health care.\"  The president-elect has promised to repeal Obamacare as one of his first acts after taking office on January 20, but he has yet to lay out a detailed plan on how he'd replace it.  --CNN Correspondent Phil Mattingly contributed to this story.

{"text": "When a watch costs $40,000, you don't want to end up with buyer's remorse. Enter Eleven James, a company that offers men the chance to try out a new watch for a few months at a time, by allowing its members to rent different luxury watches several times a year.  Like NetJets, which lets customers buy \u00e0 la carte flights on private planes, Rent the Runway for pricey party dresses and Bag Borrow or Steal for high-end handbags, Eleven James gives customers access to luxury watches they may not be able to afford or may just want to test out without the five-figure price tag and lifetime commitment.  Users make two primary choices: what type of watches they want to wear and how frequently they want to change. There are currently three tiers, based on watches that retail for $10,000, $20,000 and $40,000. They then choose how many times they want to switch it up -- between three and six times per year. They fill out a preference sheet based on brands and styles they're interested in, and work with a concierge to figure out which watches they'll try next.  Membership for the least expensive watches, brands like Breitling, Panerai and Rolex, start at $199 per month, or $2,150 per year. On the high end, for watches like Patek Philippe and A. Lange & Sohne, it can reach $1,379 per month, or $14,900 per year.  Related: 13 things to know about the Apple Watch  In an age when a clock is displayed on any of the expensive electronic devices people already carry, why would anyone pay to borrow a device that only tells time?  According to Randy Brandoff, Eleven James' founder and CEO, the watch is still what makes an outfit, and there's a tremendous amount of heritage and craftsmanship that many people, especially in the professional sphere, still appreciate.  But because it's such a huge purchase, and a person can only wear one at a time, the idea of getting to try out a number of different watches without first having to buy one is appealing, he said.  Santo Rosabianca is one customer who'd grown tired of his old Omega. But after signing up with Eleven James, he suddenly had new options that suited his tastes -- a Chopard Grand Prix de Monaco to fit his Formula 1 fandom, and an Italian-made Panerai to appeal to his Italian heritage.  \"Everyone I meet compliments me and it's brought me new business. It's a real conversation starter,\" he said. \"I've been really blessed by it.\"  Of course, it appeals to collectors who are intrigued by the idea of trying out all kinds of watches and models several times a year. But it's also bringing in a new customer.  \"We're seeing millennials who, as adults, are getting ever more curious,\" he said. \"It's a pretty big leap to go from an iPhone to a Rolex, so they want to try them out.\"  That's good news for the watch industry, since Brandoff said the company is attracting clients who weren't yet collecting or had become apathetic because they didn't have any variety. It makes sense, then, that 85% of its members said they were more likely to purchase a watch within the next year because of the service.  Brent Handler was one of them. He ended up purchasing the first watch he was sent to try from Eleven James. He owned a Cartier watch his wife bought him before, and didn't think he needed to spend $10,000 on another one, until he became \"enamored with\" the Zenith watch he was borrowing.  \"I'm 46 years old. I have three kids. There aren't that many new things that I get to experience,\" he said. \"But when I get a call six times a year from a concierge saying, 'what kind of watch do you want?' that's something to look forward to.\"  Eleven James also avoids the regret that often comes with make a big watch purchase. Eric Wind, a contributor to the online watch magazine Hodinkee, said that many people lament that they didn't know that much about watches or didn't know what they would like when they bought an expensive watch, and then they're stuck with it.  \"Watch tastes typically evolve over time and the luxury watch rental services provide users with that commodity of time -- literally,\" he said.

Little memorable had ever happened in the car, Buffett recalled, aside from a conversation with General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra. He asked her about what features he might be able to get in a new car and Barra talked him into parting with his DTS and getting a brand new Cadillac XTS last July.

Trump's opponents, including John Kasich and Mike Huckabee, got 12-minutes of free air time on NBC affiliate stations.   But last month, Trump accused \"SNL\" of rigging the election. He said it was time \"to retire the boring and unfunny show.\" Trump added that Baldwin's portrayal of him \"stinks.\"  Trump's tweet about \"SNL\" followed his criticisms Saturday regarding the Broadway hit, \"Hamilton,\" which he called \"highly overrated.\"  Trump's team did not immediately respond with further comment.

{"text": "Executives and anchors from the country's five biggest television networks met with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower on Monday afternoon. And they got an earful.  Trump vented about media coverage, according to sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He was highly critical of CNN and other news organizations.  But while Trump showed disdain for the news media, he also answered questions; listened to the journalists' arguments about the importance of access; and committed to making improvements.  A source in the room told CNNMoney that there was \"real progress\" made with regards to media access to Trump and his administration.  One specific topic was the importance of the \"press pool,\" a small group of journalists that traditionally travels with the president.  The hour-long meeting was off the record, meaning the participants agreed not to talk about the substance of the conversations.  But Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, who arranged the meeting, said afterward that it was \"very cordial, candid and honest.\"  While there was \"no need to mend fences,\" she said, \"from my own perspective, it is great to hit the reset button, it was a long, hard-fought campaign.\"  Some of the attendees were struck by Trump's anti-media posture. During the meeting, Trump revived some of the specific arguments he made weeks before winning the presidency.  According to Politico, among Trump's complaints, even as he asked for a \"cordial\" relationship, was that NBC had used unflattering pictures of him.  But one of the participants told CNNMoney that Trump also asked for a positive relationship between his White House and the media. The participant said that a New York Post account -- which had a source describing it as Trump giving the assembled members of the media a \"dressing down\" like a \"firing squad\" -- was overstated.  Conway herself has also criticized the Post report.  Notably, she declined to say when the president-elect would hold a news conference. \"Soon\" was the only answer.  Presidents-elect typically hold a news conference within days of being elected. Trump was elected almost two weeks ago and has not taken questions in that setting yet.  However, he has been interviewed on the CBS newsmagazine \"60 Minutes,\" and he answered a few shouted questions from reporters over the weekend. He will also be speaking with reporters from The New York Times on Tuesday.  Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. \"and others are meeting with the President Elect tomorrow at the request of his team,\" the Times said in a statement Monday afternoon. \"There will be a small, off the record meeting first, followed by an on the record session with Times reporters and editorial columnists.\"  President Obama and other government officials occasionally hold off the record sessions with reporters, anchors and other media bigwigs. Obama, for example, talked off the record with the reporters traveling with him on the way home from Peru on Sunday night.  By going off the record and giving up the right to quote the public official, the reporters gain candid insights. Both the journalists and the politicians can speak more bluntly.  Some top network anchors are traveling or on vacation this week, and thus were unable to attend Monday's meeting. But many others were present.  NBC's Chuck Todd and Lester Holt; CNN's Wolf Blitzer and Erin Burnett; CBS's Norah O'Donnell, Charlie Rose, John Dickerson, and Gayle King; and ABC's George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz were some of the anchors seen entering Trump Tower shortly before 1 p.m.  Several executives from the network news divisions were also spotted on the way into Trump Tower, including ABC News president James Goldston; CNN president Jeff Zucker; Fox News co-presidents Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy; NBC News president Deborah Turness; MSNBC president Phil Griffin; and CBS News vice president Chris Isham.  There was much for the group to talk about. Trump has long-standing relationships with many in the TV news business -- but he also waged an anti-media crusade during his campaign for president.  Related: No news conference by Trump yet  There are many looming questions about whether Trump will provide the same levels of press access that past presidents have permitted, like the traveling \"press pool\" and regular news conferences.

{"text": "Tesla's new Model S P85D is so good it broke Consumer Reports' scoring system. Consumer Reports rates vehicles on a zero-to-100 scale, but Tesla's high-performance, all-wheel-drive car scored 103.  \"Consumer Reports had to make changes to its scoring methodology to account for the car's exceptionally strong performance,\" the magazine said in a statement.  To bring the score back in line, the P85D was given less credit for areas in which the Model S already beat other cars but, in this version, simply exceeded on those measures even more.  For instance, it was given less credit for improving its acceleration and efficiency which, in other versions of the Model S, already outperformed other cars.  Once those changes were made, the P85D earned the top score of 100, making it the first car ever to earn that score.  Two years ago, a Tesla (TSLA) Model S earned a near-perfect score of 99. That car had less power than the P85D, however, and didn't have all-wheel-drive.  In the magazine's tests, the P85D accelerated from a stop to 60 miles an hour in 3.5 seconds. That's slightly slower than the 3.2 seconds Tesla claims for the car, but it still makes the P85D the quickest car the magazine has ever tested. (The second-quickest was the Porsche 911, which the magazine's test drivers got from zero to 60 mph in 4.1 seconds.)  The all-electric Tesla also got the equivalent of 87 miles per gallon in efficiency tests.  At a total price of $127,820, the Model S P85D wasn't just the highest-scoring car Consumer Reports has ever tested. It was also the most expensive, said Jake Fisher, head of auto testing for Consumer Reports.  Photos - Priciest cars from the Pebble Beach auctions  The 100-point score doesn't mean the Tesla Model S P85D is, literally, perfect.  Especially given its price, the materials in the Tesla were not as nice as those in other six-figure cars. It was also louder and didn't ride as nicely.  Also, because the car is purely electrically powered, long road trips could be less convenient than they would be in a gasoline-powered car, the magazine noted.  The next-highest score after the Tesla Model S is the Mercedes-Benz S550, a full-sized luxury sedan. Consumer Reports tests cars on its own track in Connecticut and also on public roads and highways.  This isn't the first time the Model S has defied ordinary measures. The Model S has earned 5-star crash safety ratings from the federal government but, according to Tesla, ordinary safety tests weren't enough. In rollover tests, the car wouldn't flip even in the hardest turns and \"special measures\" had to be used to get it to turn over. During roof crush tests, the roof-crushing machine broke before the car's roof did, according to the automaker.

{"text": "The sale of Uber's China operations to rival Didi Chuxing could wind up being a big win for ... Apple. Here's how.  As a result of the deal, Didi owns a part of Uber and Uber owns a portion of Didi.  And since Apple owns a stake in Didi, it now also owns a teeny bit of Uber -- and the same is true for other big-shot investors.  It's just one quirky result of a deal that touches many of the world's top tech companies: Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Softbank -- they're all involved.  Here's an overview of the major investors, and what the deal means for them:  Apple: The iPhone maker plowed a whopping $1 billion into Didi Chuxing in May.  At the time, founder and CEO Cheng Wei said Apple's (AAPL, Tech30) investment was \"an enormous encouragement and inspiration for our four-year-old company.\"  Since Didi already has a partnership with other ride-sharing companies such as Lyft, India's Ola and Southeast Asia's GrabTaxi, Apple now has money invested in all of the world's major ride-sharing giants.  Baidu: Chinese search giant Baidu (BIDU, Tech30) invested in Uber's China operations in late 2014, and it currently owns a minority stake in the Chinese business. The partnership allowed Uber to use Baidu's mapping and mobile technology to connect drivers and riders, helping it expand from nine Chinese cities to about 60 in less than two years.  Tencent: The Chinese tech behemoth Tencent (TCEHY), which owns a web of mobile, telecom and online retail businesses, was an early backer of Didi Chuxing.  It poured millions in Didi Dache, the homegrown ride-sharing firm that eventually merged with a rival to create Didi Chuxing.  Alibaba: Chinese tech heavyweight Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) backed the other half of Didi Chuxing, which was called Kuaidi Dache.  Softbank: Japanese telecom Softbank (SFTBF) led a major $600 million financing round into Kuaidi Dache back in early 2015.  Related: Investors hate Softbank's latest tech deal  The car companies: Automakers have shown significant interest in ride-sharing tech.

{"text": "Well, it's that time again. You and your closest 27 million friends and family members are flying for Thanksgiving. The crush, which started on Friday, runs through Sunday. Here's your guide to not only survive, but thrive, as you conquer the airport.  1. Leave enough time  Online check-in begins 24 hours before departure, and most airlines recommend you get to the airport no less than two hours before your scheduled departure. Bottom line: The more time you have, the more time to adjust if your plans are disrupted.  The good news is that your chances of arriving on time are better than ever. According to the Department of Transportation, airlines canceled 0.3% of scheduled domestic flights in September, the lowest rate since 1995.  2. Know your rights on overbooking  U.S. airlines have been steadily increasing capacity, but that doesn't mean your flight won't be overbooked and you may get bumped. Department of Transportation has outlined the rules that airlines have to follow when bumping passengers. Know your rights as a traveler.  3. What happens if your plans are disrupted  Download your airline's app on your phone or tablet. Many will help you find alternate flights and rebookings. Ultimately you can skip waiting in line at the airport or hanging on hold over the phone.  You can call in outside help, too. Cranky Concierge, a service run by travel expert and airline blogger Brett Snyder, can monitor your travels, watching for delays and prepare alternate flight options.  4. Charge your batteries  Many airlines now offer in-seat power, but make sure your devices are charged before you fly. And if you want to be an airport superhero, pack a power strip.  Many older aircraft have also gotten new seats with power and in-flight entertainment screens.  5. Keep entertained  Wifi internet access is now available on most U.S. mainline flights for an added fee and free on airlines like JetBlue Airways (JBLU). While internet may cost you, airlines like American (AAL), Southwest (LUV), Delta (DAL) and United offer on-board servers that stream content to your devices for free.  You can typically get access to free -- or paid -- streaming content with an airline's app. Access to streaming services on airlines like American and Alaska Airlines are offered through the Gogo In-Flight Entertainment App.  If all else fails, raise that window shade and enjoy the view. Or strike up a conversation with your seatmate, just don't talk about politics.  6. Be good to each other  I'll leave you with this. Be good to your fellow travelers, airline and airport staff. While they, too, may be grumpy from a constant onslaught of travel madness, a smile goes a long, long way.  Safe travels.

{"text": "Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer stands to make $55 million if the struggling company gets sold -- and she gets booted. The company revealed Mayer's severance package and her 2015 pay when it updated its annual report on Friday evening.  Mayer's golden parachute would be a huge payout for a chief executive who hasn't been able to stop the technology behemoth's free fall. In 2015, the value of her company's stock fell by 33%.  Most of the $55 million severance package is made up of restricted stock units and options. Only $3 million is actual cash.  On Friday, Yahoo also revealed that Mayer got a significant pay cut last year.  Her \"reported pay\" -- what she was promised -- was $36 million. But her \"realized pay\" -- what she was actually able to keep -- is closer to $14 million. Because of the complex nature of executive pay, she could wind up making more than that someday in the future.  Either way, though, it's a massive pay cut from the previous year, when her \"reported pay\" was $42 million.  Mayer's income was drastically reduced \"because the company's 2015 performance fell short of the rigorous annual financial goals we set,\" the company states in its annual report.  The report also reveals Yahoo's executives decided to give up their bonuses last year.  Yahoo (YHOO, Tech30) representatives declined to provide additional comment to CNNMoney.   There's lots of attention on Mayer's pay, because her tenure at Yahoo could soon be over. Her four-year odyssey to improve Yahoo's finances hasn't worked.

Yet the company's core business -- Internet advertising -- has been completely overtaken by Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Google (GOOGL, Tech30).  While Yahoo treads water, it's the tiny Silicon Valley players that are landing the huge deals, like Snapchat partnering with NBC for Olympics coverage.  In an effort to cut costs, Yahoo fired 15% of its staff earlier this year. But the latest numbers were abysmal, with Yahoo posting a $99 million loss in the first quarter of 2016. As a result, Mayer has said that selling Yahoo is now \"a top priority.\"  It's gotten so bad that activist investors have swooped in, and Mayer's arch-nemesis is now her boss.

Rounding out the top five are Hong Kong, where the real estate industry is the main driver of wealth; Los Angeles, fueled by entertainment and San Francisco, driven by tech wealth.  At least half of these wealthy buyers use a mortgage to purchase their property. The report noted that wealthy individuals tend to keep large amounts of cash on hand (roughly 25% of their net worth), primarily for use in businesses opportunities. Mortgages, especially in this low interest rate environment, keep more money available.  Females preferred high end real residential estate as an investment over males. Wealthy women held 16% of their net worth in real estate verses less than 10% for wealthy men. On average, 64% of a rich person's net wealth is held in business interests.  While cities -- with their proximity to businesses centers -- tended to dominate the list, the report also noted several hot spots that were popular for lifestyle reasons. In the United States, the top locations for vacation homes for the wealthy were Southampton, NY; Aspen, CO; Naples, FL; Greenwich, CT and Palm Beach, FL.

{"text": "Tesla is planning to build its electric cars in China. \"At some point in the next three or four years we'll be establishing local manufacturing in China,\" CEO Elon Musk said in Beijing. \"China is very important to the future of Tesla.\"  Musk was in Beijing to mark the first deliveries of Tesla's Model S to customers in China, where the sports car sells for around $115,000.  Electric vehicle sales in the world's second biggest economy have been tepid so far, but many automakers see great potential. The country's middle class is expanding rapidly and is increasingly interested in luxury cars.  China also faces a growing air pollution problem, and the government is working to encourage the adoption of electric cars.  Yet much of China lacks the infrastructure needed to support them.  State media reported that Tesla (TSLA) is ready to help change that, with Musk pledging to launch a nationwide battery charging and service network by 2015.  \"We're going to make a big investment in China in terms of charging infrastructure,\" Musk said.  The automaker has already built a supercharger network in the United States, making it easier for Tesla drivers to travel between major cities.  Related story: Will Tesla's bet on China pay off?  China isn't the only place Tesla wants to build a new factory.  It has plans for a massive U.S. facility that is expected to produce more lithium ion batteries annually by 2020 than were produced worldwide in 2013.  Tesla estimates the new factory will cost $4 billion to $5 billion and employ about 6,500 people. It could be located in either Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico or Texas.  Making more batteries, and reducing their cost, are vital to Tesla's ability to produce a cheaper car in numbers that could catapult the company into the ranks of the major automakers.

Now, after disappointing sales in China, the firm is scaling back its staff.  Tesla has been cutting jobs since early this year as part of a larger restructuring plan, said spokesman Gary Tao. Much of that has already taken place, and Tao described the current team as \"strong and steady.\"  He also said that it's normal for people to come and go in companies, and declined to confirm a Chinese media report that Tesla was eliminating 180 jobs, or 30% of its workforce.

The company also wants to build a factory in China in the next few years.  CEO Elon Musk said in January that China sales were weak because \"there was a misconception that charging was difficult.\" The main issue was that urban residents -- who don't always have access to a private family garage like in the U.S. -- thought they wouldn't be able to have a charger at home.  Tesla has invested many resources into building charging stations, and has plans to construct hundreds in China.  Tesla's Model S sedan costs around $115,000 in China.

{"text": "Donald Trump thinks that even \"Saturday Night Live\" is part of a media conspiracy to bring down his presidential candidacy. Saturday night, SNL opened with a mocking reenactment of the second presidential debate. The parody included the moderators taking shots, a kung fu style greeting between Trump and Hillary Clinton and an ode to town hall questioner -- and 15-minute celebrity -- Ken Bone.  But the biggest laughs came from Alec Baldwin's portrayal of a stalking, lewd, deceptive Trump. The live SNL audience was cracking up, but apparently the real Trump wasn't.  In a tweet, the Republican nominee said that Baldwin's portrayal \"stinks.\" He also called on NBC to end its \"boring and unfunny\" show. And he said that SNL was trying to rig the election against him.  As CNNMoney's Brian Stelter noted, Trump sang quite a different tune 11 months ago, when he hosted the show. It was the second time he appeared on the show -- he also hosted in 2004, though he has been impersonated dozens of times.   Trump has been increasingly targeting the media as the culprit of his poor polling numbers. He has repeated the refrain of a \"rigged\" election since the virtually tied race started to slip away from him following the first debate on September 26. Since then, Clinton has led most polls by a comfortable margin.  Though attacks on the press from political candidates are nothing new (Clinton has expressed her fair share of gripes), Stelter notes that Trump's position is far more extreme than his predecessors.

{"text": "President-elect Donald Trump still has not held a news conference, a break from tradition that is keeping reporters and the public in the dark about the transition to his administration. Going back at least to 1976, when Jimmy Carter was elected, no president-elect has waited so long after the election was decided to speak to reporters. Most did it within the first three days. Trump was elected 10 days ago.  Aides say the public will not have to wait much longer.  \"I'm sure he will do one very soon,\" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told CNNMoney in an email. \"Obviously it would be good to have some news to share as most of the questions will be speculative regarding cabinet appointments, etc., but we look forward to having a news conference in the near future.\"  Trump addressed his supporters late on election night, spoke briefly from the Oval Office with President Barack Obama on Nov. 10, and gave an interview to CBS's \"60 Minutes\" on Nov. 11.  But he has not held a news conference to field questions from other reporters, who would almost certainly ask about reports of a rocky transition, Cabinet appointees and the many potential conflicts of interest posed by Trump's business interests around the world.  The president-elect plans to travel to Bedminster, New Jersey, where he owns a golf club, on Friday and spend the weekend there, a spokesman said.  In the week and a half since he defeated Hillary Clinton, Trump has shown a willingness to ignore political norms.  He has twice traveled without the journalists assigned to cover him. The so-called press pool serves as the public's eyes on the president, monitoring his movements and whereabouts.  On Tuesday evening, after Hicks told the journalists there would be no further news or travel for the day, Trump took his family out to eat. Reporters only learned about it when a financial journalist who happened to be in the restaurant tweeted a picture.  The White House Correspondents Association called the evasion \"unacceptable.\"  Related: Backlash after Donald Trump ditches press pool   In 2012, Obama, who was already in office, gave a news conference eight days after his re-election. And in 1992, President-elect Bill Clinton waited nine days to take questions from reporters. Most presidents-elect in recent history have done so sooner.  In 2008, the newly elected Obama called a press conference three days after the election and vowed to \"confront this economic crisis head on.\"  In 2000, President-elect George W. Bush took questions three days after the Supreme Court decided Bush vs. Gore.

{"text": "It's time to start paying attention to Saudi Aramco. Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company is the biggest in the world. It's being prepared for a mammoth stock market listing to raise money to help reduce the kingdom's addiction to oil.  A small portion of Saudi Aramco will be listed as early as 2017, and the shares could trade on up to four markets: New York, London, Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh.  Here's what you need to know about this oil behemoth before the IPO comes around:  $2 trillion   Deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is pushing economic reform, estimates that the IPO will value the Saudi Arabian Oil Company -- Aramco for short -- at more than $2 trillion.  That would make it about four times the size of Apple (AAPL, Tech30) and over five times the size of ExxonMobil (XOM), the West's biggest oil producer by market value.  But just how much Aramco is worth is hotly debated. Per Magnus Nysveen, a senior partner at Rystad Energy, believes that oil would have to be trading at $70 a barrel -- not $45 -- to support the prince's estimate.  Robin Mills, founder and CEO at Qamar Energy, estimates the company is worth much less -- between $250 billion to $400 billion -- because it pays a huge amount of tax and faces a declining market in the long run.  1 in 8 barrels  Aramco says it produces one out of every eight barrels of oil in the world, or about 12% of global production, more than any other single producer.  It pumps about 10.3 million barrels per day. That is more than twice its closest competitor Rosneft, Russia's state-owned producer.   261 billion barrels  Aramco says it has 261 billion barrels of oil in reserves, giving the company plenty of resources to exploit in the years ahead. That's more than all of North America's oil reserves put together.  BP's highly respected report on oil statistics estimates Saudi Arabia has even more in reserve -- 267 billion barrels -- which is nearly 16% of the global total. But not everyone is convinced that these figures are 100% legit.  \"Saudi Arabia's official estimates are overstated,\" said Rystad Energy's Nysveen. \"It might be 267 billion barrels of oil in the ground, but it's impossible to prove according to agreed regulations.\"  One million barrels  That's roughly how much oil the U.S. buys from Aramco each day. Japan imports a similar volume of Saudi oil, as does India.  China is Aramco's biggest overseas customer, buying about 1.4 million barrels per day, according to Rystad data.  Aramco sells about 75% of its oil overseas, with the balance sold at discounted prices into the domestic market.  93% tax  Aramco does not say how much tax it pays, but Qamar Energy's Robin Mills estimates the rate at 93% since the company hands nearly all its revenue to the state.  Indeed, the oil sector accounts for roughly 87% of the country's budget revenues.  Such a high tax rate could dissuade investors from buying into the IPO as they may worry that they won't get a fair share of the profits.  Mills said the company and kingdom will want to rethink the current tax arrangement ahead of the IPO.  \"If they lowered the taxes, they probably could get to the $2 trillion [valuation],\" said Mills.  $9.90   Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are the only countries in the world that can pump a barrel of oil for less than $10.  Many other major oil producing nations have much higher pumping costs, which means they suffer huge setbacks when prices fall too low.  Saudi Arabia also suffers from lower revenue, but it isn't forced to shutter operations.  This helps explain why it keeps pumping oil into an oversupplied market -- it helps the country maintain its market share at the expense of other producers.   65,000 employees  Aramco said it employs about 65,000 workers in a country with a population of 28 million.  But the company estimates that it currently creates work, either directly or indirectly, for about 200,000 people.  It's hoping to grow that figure to about 500,000 jobs over the next decade as it looks to expand into related sectors such chemicals.  --CNNMoney's John Defterios contributed to this report.

The union representing the pilots said they will walk off the job on Tuesday and Wednesday. The first day of disruption will result in the cancellation of 816 short-haul flights. Some 82,000 passengers will be affected.  On Wednesday, the union will turn its attention to all Lufthansa-operated flights departing from Germany. Lufthansa has already announced that 98,000 travelers will be affected by 890 flight cancellations that day.  The pilots' union said in a statement that the German airline has not yet put forward a reasonable offer that can serve as a basis for negotiation. Lufthansa, meanwhile, has described the union's demands as \"unacceptable.\"  The strike, which began last week, has forced Lufthansa to cancel a total of 4,461 flights over the course of six days. Roughly 525,000 passengers have been affected, according to the airline.  Lufthansa is encouraging customers to check the status of their flight online. It has also apologized to customers and said that passengers will not be charged a fee to rebook. Flights to and from Germany operated by the Lufthansa Group's other airlines -- Eurowings, Germanwings, SWISS, Austrian Airlines, Air Dolomiti and Brussels Airlines -- are not affected by the strike.

Now, legal experts tell CNNMoney that, if true, such actions could make 21st Century Fox liable to its shareholders.  \"As a general rule it is an actionable breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty for a corporate executive to use company funds for personal purposes,\" Lynn Stout, the Distinguished Professor of Corporate & Business Law at Cornell University, said.

Others say 21st Century Fox can make the case that Ailes' handling of the funds was beneficial to the company.  \"It is forbidden to use corporate funds for private purposes.

{"text": "The war for control over Yahoo appears to have claimed its first victims -- Yahoo's staff. Embattled CEO Marissa Mayer is expected to announce layoffs of 15% of Yahoo's workforce, according to the Wall Street Journal. She is set to break the news when the company reports its quarterly finances on Tuesday afternoon.  A spokeswoman from Yahoo declined to comment, citing Yahoo's quiet period ahead of its earnings announcement.  The layoffs would give Mayer another tool in her arsenal to fight off a looming fight with activist shareholders, who want to wrest control of the company away from her. By making Yahoo leaner and more profitable, Mayer could gain some key supporters.  Angry investors, led by hedge fund Starboard Value, say that Mayer and her team have made no progress over the past three-and-a-half years in their attempt to turn around Yahoo's fortunes. Despite spending billions of dollars buying numerous companies, changing the company's logo and hiring A-list media personalities, Yahoo's core Internet advertising business has continued to lose ground to Google (GOOGL, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30).  Yahoo's (YHOO, Tech30) board continues to have Mayer's back. Together, they staved off a potentially ugly battle for control of the company in December, when Yahoo agreed with Starboard's demands to spin off the core Internet business into a separate company and keep Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba, potentially saving billions of dollars in taxes.  But Starboard wasn't satisfied with that plan alone. In January, the company's manager Jeffrey Smith called for \"significant changes across all aspects of the business starting at the board level, and including executive leadership.\"  Trimming Yahoo's staff might buy Mayer time to make the necessary changes.  Pivotal Research Group urged investors to buy Yahoo, noting that \"circumstances are sufficiently dire\" that it's \"much more likely now\" that the company will make changes that unlock shareholder value.  Related: Hedge fund is sick of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer  But there's no guarantee that she'll ultimately get to keep her job. Mayer has done little to prove that Yahoo can ever be turned around. And this isn't the first time Yahoo has tried mass layoffs: Yahoo has already reduced its staff by about a quarter since 2012, just before Mayer took over.  Mayer has repeatedly said that Yahoo has just scratched the surface in the turnaround that she believes the struggling company is capable of. She has said Yahoo is now correctly targeting its audience's daily Internet habits, and it's just a matter of time before Yahoo starts gaining momentum.  But investors are growing tired of waiting.  \"Although it already has all of the assets it needs to execute a decent turnaround, there is no sign of Yahoo ever fulfilling its potential,\" said Richard Windsor, analyst at Edison Investment Research.  Mayer appears to be in a no-win situation. By acknowledging that Yahoo hasn't yet lived up to its turnaround potential, she is in effect indicting her own leadership. And by laying off staff, she might be sacrificing Yahoo's long-term viability for near-term gains.  Firing Mayer won't be easy. It would cost at least $25 million in severance, and she just gave birth to twins.  But there's one potential road out that might appease shareholders, activist investors, Yahoo's board and Mayer alike: Bloomberg reports that Yahoo is reassessing whether to spin off its main Internet business. Instead, it is considering an outright sale.  That strategy jibes with Yahoo's recent investments, heavily ramping up staffing and redesigns for its popular finance and sports businesses. That makes it potentially much more attractive to a media company that wants to scoop it up.  AOL-owner Verizon (VZ, Tech30) has publicly stated that it would consider buying Yahoo. (Maybe, after years of courting one another, AOL and Yahoo will merge after all!)  Meanwhile, Yahoo's fourth-quarter earnings are expected to be something of a disaster.

{"text": "All of Yahoo's glaring holes came to light on Tuesday, when it reported its first-quarter finances. It wasn't pretty. Yahoo posted a big loss, and sales fell by double digits.  CEO Marissa Mayer has made little progress over the past four years in her attempt to turn around Yahoo's fortunes. Despite spending billions of dollars buying numerous companies, hiring A-list media personalities, and shifting the focus to high-growth areas like mobile and video, Yahoo's core Internet advertising business has continued to lose ground to Google (GOOGL, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30).  It's not exactly a great time for Yahoo to be putting its core Internet business up for sale.  Bids were due on Monday. Yahoo has stayed mum on its potential suitors, and Mayer has reportedly been reluctant to provide detailed information about Yahoo's business and finances to bidders.  Mayer defiantly denied those reports, saying that she and the board have made the sale process \"a top priority.\" She said she fielded \"hundreds of questions\" on the telephone from some of the most \"well-known, respected names in the industry.\"  Though she said Yahoo will not be providing updates as it continues its search for a buyer, she said the company is being aggressive in its pace to reach a deal.  Verizon (VZ, Tech30), owner of Yahoo rival AOL, is expected to be the top bidder and the most likely company to eventually buy Yahoo.  Related: Yahoo makes it easier to give Mayer a giant payday  Yahoo's management believes that the company is woefully undervalued, and the best turnaround plan is a healthy dose of staying the course and patience.  Mayer has repeatedly said that Yahoo has just scratched the surface in its potential to grow. She believes Yahoo's struggling legacy desktop advertising business will soon be overtaken by its growing mobile, video, native advertising and social media businesses. In the first quarter, those businesses brought in 38% of Yahoo's overall sales.  Yahoo is also in the process of offloading its massive stakes in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) and Yahoo Japan, which constitute virtually the entire value of Yahoo. Effectively, that means the stock market has valued Yahoo's core Internet business as worthless.  Even Yahoo's biggest detractors don't believe Yahoo is worth $0.  Shedding Yahoo's Asian holdings and giving the company's turnaround plan time to succeed may give Yahoo the boost it needs to compete for the future. But we'll likely never know.  Yahoo (YHOO, Tech30) could be sold soon. If it's not, Mayer and Yahoo's entire board faces a revolt from activist shareholder Starboard Value, which has said it would push to remove Mayer and all the directors at Yahoo's shareholder meeting this spring.  Meanwhile, it's (bad) business as usual for Yahoo.  Profit  First quarter of 2015: $21 million First quarter of 2016: -$99 million  Yahoo lost $99 million as its legacy search business declined 15% and the share of search sales that Yahoo pays to its partners increased by 44%.  Still, that loss looks pretty good compared to the $4.4 billion loss Yahoo posted in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Sales  First quarter of 2015: $1.2 billion First quarter of 2016: $1.1 billion, down 11%  Yahoo has been spending a lot of money in an effort to accelerate the growth of its core businesses.  But that isn't happening overnight, and there are signs that Mayer's plan has some holes in it. Yahoo said its mobile, video, native ads and social grew by just 7% this quarter, far slower than last year's growth.  This quarter  Second quarter of 2016 revenue forecast: $1.05 billion to $1.09 billion  This quarter, Wall Street analysts had expected sales to come in at $1.1 billion, so Yahoo's forecast came in slightly below analysts' expectations.

Demand for the devices appeared lukewarm over the holidays, a period of time that usually brings in a lot of gadget sales. But Apple managed to become the top smartwatch maker in 2015, according to Canalys, Juniper Research and IDC. (Apple doesn't publicly disclose sales figures.)  That lead gives Apple some time to make its next Watch a reflection of customer feedback. Some expect the company to release a new model of the Watch in the fall.

(The original iPod became a blockbuster after Apple made it compatible with PCs.) Apple should also think about allowing more retailers to sell the devices and toying with its pricing model even more.  The Apple Watch is the company's first new device category since CEO Tim Cook took over.  Traditional watchmakers are likely following Monday's news closely. They're gathered at a luxury watch event Baselworld in Basel, Switzerland this week.  Since Apple launched its Apple Watch, the traditional watch industry has struggled with headwinds -- losing significant sales and profits. In response, companies like Movado and Fossil have had to change their products and acquire startups to compete in a tech-first world.

Cook was spotted by local media during a pre-dawn visit to a Hindu temple in Mumbai on Wednesday. While Apple has declined to reveal his itinerary, the chief executive is expected to meet company employees and business partners during the trip.  He's also expected to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been trying to invigorate India's manufacturing sector and develop the country's ties to Silicon Valley.  Modi visited with several top tech leaders in September, including Cook and Facebook  (FB, Tech30)CEO Mark Zuckerberg.   India represents a much smaller share of Apple's revenues than China does, but it's still an important market for the world's second biggest smartphone maker.  At the end of March, combined sales from Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India accounted for 23% of Apple's total. That compares with 25% from sales in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.  While sales plummeted in every major global region for Apple, Indian sales actual soared 56% last quarter. In the previous quarter, Apple's sales grew by 76%.  Cook said on a conference call with analysts last month that he was pleased with that growth. He should be: It was one of the only bright spots in an otherwise miserable quarter, in which iPhone sales fell for the first time ever, and sales declined for the first time in 13 years.

India is already a vast consumer market for global businesses, and it's expected to get even bigger. By 2022, it's forecast to surpass China to become the world's most populous country.  But Indians' average income and spending power are far lower than those of Westerners. A lot of smartphones sell for less than $100 in India, and data plans are affordable for members of the growing middle class.  Apple devices remain very much in the luxury bracket, retailing for many hundreds of dollars. But the high-end part of the market is expected to greatly expand as India's economy continues to grow.

Smith, who manages hedge fund Starboard Value, has joined Yahoo's board along with three other directors chosen by Smith.  As part of the deal, Starboard has dropped its proposal to replace Yahoo's entire slate of directors with new board members of the hedge fund's choosing. Saying the company was \"extremely disappointed\" with Yahoo's management, Starboard went nuclear in March and moved to get rid of Mayer and all those who support her.  Smith struck a friendlier tone on Wednesday.  \"We look forward to getting started right away and working closely with management and our fellow board members with the common goal of maximizing value for all shareholders,\" Smith said in a prepared statement.  Mayer is on Yahoo's board and had largely chosen her co-directors herself. Yahoo's directors have backed her throughout a 19-month-long standoff with Smith and Starboard.  Related: Marissa Mayer could get up to $37 million if she's fired  Though she sits on the board, as CEO, Mayer also reports to the board and recuses herself of certain discussions about executive leadership.  Mayer acknowledged that the appointment of Yahoo's four new directors represented a significant detente in the ongoing battle, which was distracting the company from its simultaneous turnaround and sale efforts.  \"This constructive resolution will allow management and the board to keep our focus on our extremely important objectives,\" said Mayer, in a statement.  Despite shareholder criticism that Mayer and Yahoo have not been serious about selling the company, Mayer said earlier in April that the sale process was \"a top priority\" for the company.

Yahoo will also gain Richard Hill, who has led several technology companies, and Tor Braham, who used to be Deutsche Bank's head of tech mergers and acquisitions.

{"text": "Tesla has officially entered the Chinese auto market. \"As of now, TESLA Model S reservations are being accepted,\" Tesla said Wednesday on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site similar to Twitter.  Tesla's Model S is manufactured in California and the Netherlands. It has been for sale in the United States since 2012 and has recently gone on sale in Europe.  Elon Musk, Tesla's founder and CEO, discussed plans to expand into China following the release of corporate results earlier this month.  Related: Elon Musk's greatest hits  A representative from Tesla declined to answer questions about the company's China plans.  China has become the world's biggest market for automobiles, surpassing the United States. Major global automakers are fighting for market share. General Motors (GM), one of the top-selling automakers in China, currently sells the Chevy Volt plug-in hybrid there -- although in very limited quantities.  Electric car sales in China are currently miniscule, said Jeff Schuster, an industry analyst with LMC Automotive. Out of 18 million passenger vehicles sold in China last year, just 22,000 were plug-ins. That number is expected to grow to 60,000 next year, however.  Tesla (TSLA) has said that, if demand in Europe and Asia meets projections, the company could sell 40,000 Model S cars annually by next year.  The Model S should appeal to Chinese luxury consumers' tastes for distinctive, high-tech products, said Tim Dunne, an analyst with J.D. Power and Associates. Chinese consumers, especially wealthy ones, tend to want show off the latest technology.  \"The newest of the new always does well in China,\" he said.  Related: Cool cars from the Beijing Auto Show  Past attempts to sell electric cars in China haven't fared well, Dunne said, because they were targeted at more conservative mass-market consumers.  Prices for the Tesla Model S start at $70,000 in the United States, but because of high tariffs on automobiles produced outside of China, imported cars can cost much more than they do in the U.S. But Dunne said the Model S should be sufficiently distinctive to overcome that barrier.  \"When you're living and working among a billion people, you're trying to set yourself apart,\" he said.  Schuster was skeptical that the Model S would sell in big numbers in the short term. Eventually, if Tesla opens manufacturing facilities in China, the car could become more attractive.  \"This is all a play for the future,\" said Schuster. \"I think they're just getting in there now for the long term.\"  Tesla has had a string of positive news in the U.S., where the Model S recently received stellar ratings in government crash tests. Consumer Reports also called the car the best it had ever tested. ", "author": "Peter Valdes-Dapena", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/22/autos/tesla-motors-china/", "date": "NA"},

GM unveiled a new, improved version of the Chevrolet Volt, which has both an electric motor and a traditional gas engine. It also debuted a small all-electric car called the Chevrolet Bolt.  The Bolt, which at this point is a concept vehicle, offers a preview of a car that GM expects to begin selling in all 50 U.S. states in 2017. It will have a 200-mile driving range on a full charge and a sticker price of around $30,000 after electric car tax incentives.  \"This is a real game changer,\" GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said at the Bolt's unveiling.  The Bolt will probably compete with Tesla's mass market electric car the Model 3, which has yet to be unveiled but is expected to sell for about $35,000 when it becomes available in the next couple of years.  Tesla has already had success with its all-electric Model S luxury sedan, which starts at nearly $70,000 and can travel at least 208 miles between charges.  Shares of Tesla (TSLA) fell 3% on GM's announcement Monday, while GM (GM) shares were trading slightly higher.  To maximize the Bolt's range, it's made of lightweight materials including aluminum, magnesium and carbon fiber, GM said.  Its price will be in line with the average amount consumers spend on cars today, said Akshay Anand, an analyst with the auto Web site KBB.com.  \"So long as the product is done properly, GM should see some serious benefits,\" he said.  GM also unveiled the second generation Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid. The new Volt had appeared briefly in front of journalists at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, but no details about the car were revealed at that time.  Besides a softer and more conventional look, the new Volt has an improved battery pack and a more efficient gasoline engine.  Today's Chevrolet Volt can go about 35 miles on a full charge, according to EPA estimates, but GM says the new Volt will go roughly 50 miles. Once that all-electric driving range runs out, the new Volt will get about 41 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving, GM claims.  The current Volt gets 37 mpg on gasoline. Volt drivers should be able to go 1,000 miles between trips to the gas pump.  With a total of 149 horsepower, the new Volt also goes from zero to 60 miles per hour faster, according to GM, reaching highway speeds in 8.4 seconds.  The new Volt can fit three passengers in the backseat thanks to a more compact battery. Today's Volt can only two can sit in the back.

The company, which started selling its Model S in China earlier this year, said in an e-mailed statement to CNNMoney that it will build the stations at China Unicom retail outlets in 120 cities. It will also build 20 superchargers at China Unicom locations as well. Superchargers, as the name implies, allow for even quicker charges and tend to be near major highways.  China Unicom is one of the largest telecom companies in China. Tesla already has a relationship with China Unicom -- it provides the 3G in-car technology for Model S vehicles in China.  The move is significant because it adds a lot of new chargers to its network. Tesla said that it already has more than 200 charging points in China.

The company has yet not disclosed vehicle sales for China. It merely said when it reported second-quarter results in July that the \"Model S is off to a very encouraging start in China.\"  In addition, Tesla settled a long-standing trademark battle with a Chinese businessman earlier this month.

{"text": "Norway is full of Tesla fans who are snapping up electric cars quicker than you can say \"environmentally friendly.\" Since Tesla (TSLA) launched its Model S in oil rich Norway in 2013, Elon Musk's company has sold nearly 6,000 cars, accounting for 3% of all autos sales.  That dwarfs Tesla's U.S. market share of just 0.2% over the same period.  Tesla has flourished in Norway, along with other electric vehicles like the Nissan Leaf, thanks to government incentives that make the zero-emissions high-end car seem like a bargain.  \"It's definitely an incentive driven market,\" said Tesla spokesperson Esben Pedersen. Teslas and other electric vehicles are spared the steep sales taxes that can easily double the cost of a car.  Norwegian drivers with electric vehicles also benefit from other perks: They can use bus lanes, park for free and don't have to pay road tolls.  In the country's capital city of Oslo, Tesla owner Frederic Hauge told CNNMoney his enthusiasm for the Model S has rubbed off on his neighbors.  \"There are five Teslas just on my road alone,\" he said, spotting three passing his window during the interview with CNNMoney.  \"It's amazing how many [electric] cars we have. In the last two years it's exploded,\" he said   Hauge believes some drivers buy Teslas because they feel a sense of guilt about Norway's exploitation of its oil resources.  As things stand, electric vehicles now account for more than 10% of all new car sales in Norway.

While Tiffany didn't mention the President-elect by name, it was clear what Tiffany was referring to when it said that there has been \"some adverse effect on traffic\" at the 5th Avenue location due to \"the impact of recent election-related activity.\"  Tiffany added that there was \"softness\" at this store and warned that sales could be hit again in the fourth quarter. The 5th Avenue store accounts for close to 10% of the company's total sales.  Overall sales for Tiffany's U.S. and other North American stores in its most recent quarter fell 2% from a year ago.  Security has been heightened on 5th Avenue since the election. There have been some protests outside Trump Tower. But much of the police activity is due to the fact that Donald Trump lives in Trump Tower and has been holed up there since the election.  Tiffany CFO Mark Erceg added during a conference call that there were \"minor disruptions to pedestrian foot traffic\" around the 5th Avenue store and that Tiffany was \"understandably cautious as to how the situation might impact sales over the coming weeks.\"  But it's not all bad news for Tiffany. Sales in China and Japan were strong, helping to lead to a slight increase in overall revenue for the company. It's the first time Tiffany's quarterly sales rose since November 2014.

{"text": "Protecting President-elect Donald Trump and his family is costing New York City more than $1 million a day, according to three city officials. And those costs won't necessarily drop significantly once he moves to the White House.  That's because Melania Trump and their 10-year old son Barron expect to stay at their home at Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan, at least until the end of the school year. And Donald Trump has indicated he plans to return home regularly, especially while they're still here.  Adding to the expense is the cost of police assigned to Trump's adult children and his grandchildren, who are also receiving Secret Service protection, John Miller, NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence & counterterrorism, told WCBS Monday. All of them live in the city, and all are entitled to receive Secret Service protection.  \"The number one imperative here is safety and security. We owe that to the president elect, his family and his team,\" said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio at a press conference on Friday. But he added the city will need help with those costs, particularly police overtime.  \"This is a very substantial undertaking. It will take substantial resources,\" he said. \"We will begin the conversation with the federal government shortly on reimbursement for the NYPD for some of the costs that we are incurring.\"  While primary responsibility for the protection of the president, or president-elect, rests with the Secret Service, local law enforcement is charged with assisting them, particularly in controlling movements of the general public.  Related: Top network executives, anchors meet with Trump  Every president is required to have local law enforcement protection when they return home during their terms. But protecting Trump in New York City is particularly costly, given that he lives in the most densely-populated neighborhood of the nation's biggest city.  \"We have never had a situation where a POTUS (president of the United States) would be here on such a regular basis,\" said de Blasio. \"The details of his future plans are unknown, but we certainly know over these next 65 days [until the inauguration] he will be here regularly. The NYPD is up to the challenge and the city of New York is up to the challenge, I have no doubt about that.\"  Related: Donald Trump says SNL was 'biased' and asks for 'equal time'  The city has sought and received reimbursement for protecting world leaders in the past, such as when heads of state visit the United Nations, de Blasio said. City records show it received $26 million in reimbursements for such expenses in the 12 months ending June 30, or about $500,000 a week. But the fact that the city will need to protect Trump on an ongoing basis is unprecedented, de Blasio said.  \"This makes [previous protection efforts] look quite small obviously,\" he said. \"We'll have to establish a new set of ground rules.\"  The police have set up barricades around Trump Tower at 56th Street and 5th Avenue, smack in the middle of the city. While a block of 56th street has basically been closed to traffic, 5th Avenue remains open, although the traffic flow on that major thoroughfare has been affected.  And as Trump moves through the city, police need to close streets accordingly. For example, the Lincoln Tunnel was closed to traffic on Friday afternoon during rush hour when Trump traveled to New Jersey.

{"text": "The Falcon Wing doors are without a doubt the coolest-looking part of Tesla's new Model X crossover SUV. And they're actually even cooler than they look. These doors sense and react to their surroundings. The Falcon Wing doors are hinged at the top, like the more familiar gullwing doors found on those classic Mercedes-Benz sports cars. But each of the Tesla (TSLA) doors has a second hinge that creates something like an elbow. That allows the doors to open in different ways depending on the situation.  The simplest and fastest way for these doors to open is up and out, like the Mercedes doors do.  But Tesla's elbow means that Model X drivers can park anywhere -- even in tight spaces.  Related: Tesla's new Model X will cost you  The Falcon Wing doors are equipped with sensors that can tell if there is something next to or above them. So if if there's a car parked right next to the Model X the top part of the door will swing up but, at the same time, the elbow will bend in. That way the bottom part of the door that runs parallel to the side of the car will be pulled almost straight up without hitting anything.  If the car is parked somewhere with a low ceiling, say a garage, the doors will go up as far as they can, then the elbows will bend out to make enough room for people to get in or out.  Tesla's ultrasonic sensors bounce high-pitched sound waves (that can't be detected by the human ear) off of objects around the vehicle to detect anything that might get in the way.  The designers wanted to preserve the smooth skin of the SUV, so the company figured out a way to do all of this without having any sensors visible on the outside of the car.  Tesla engineers invented sensors that could \"see\" through aluminum sheet metal, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said, so that they can be hidden inside the doors. Musk admitted that the Model X's incredible complexity had been a challenge in getting it ready for production.  Photos - Bentley's new SUV: Bentayga  And sensors can also see inside the door, not just outside of it. So if a Falcon Wing door is closing and there's an arm or a leg in the way it will stop moving.  Tesla engineers didn't just study science to make all this work, though. Musk said he wanted the doors' movements as graceful as possible  \"Actually, I had the engineers watch ballet,\" he said.  Hopefully, the dance will impress the 25,000 buyers who ordered a Model X before even seeing it.

There are currently three tiers, based on watches that retail for $10,000, $20,000 and $40,000. They then choose how many times they want to switch it up -- between three and six times per year. They fill out a preference sheet based on brands and styles they're interested in, and work with a concierge to figure out which watches they'll try next.  Membership for the least expensive watches, brands like Breitling, Panerai and Rolex, start at $199 per month, or $2,150 per year. On the high end, for watches like Patek Philippe and A. Lange & Sohne, it can reach $1,379 per month, or $14,900 per year.  Related: 13 things to know about the Apple Watch  In an age when a clock is displayed on any of the expensive electronic devices people already carry, why would anyone pay to borrow a device that only tells time?  According to Randy Brandoff, Eleven James' founder and CEO, the watch is still what makes an outfit, and there's a tremendous amount of heritage and craftsmanship that many people, especially in the professional sphere, still appreciate.  But because it's such a huge purchase, and a person can only wear one at a time, the idea of getting to try out a number of different watches without first having to buy one is appealing, he said.  Santo Rosabianca is one customer who'd grown tired of his old Omega. But after signing up with Eleven James, he suddenly had new options that suited his tastes -- a Chopard Grand Prix de Monaco to fit his Formula 1 fandom, and an Italian-made Panerai to appeal to his Italian heritage.  \"Everyone I meet compliments me and it's brought me new business. It's a real conversation starter,\" he said. \"I've been really blessed by it.\"  Of course, it appeals to collectors who are intrigued by the idea of trying out all kinds of watches and models several times a year. But it's also bringing in a new customer.  \"We're seeing millennials who, as adults, are getting ever more curious,\" he said. \"It's a pretty big leap to go from an iPhone to a Rolex, so they want to try them out.\"  That's good news for the watch industry, since Brandoff said the company is attracting clients who weren't yet collecting or had become apathetic because they didn't have any variety. It makes sense, then, that 85% of its members said they were more likely to purchase a watch within the next year because of the service.  Brent Handler was one of them. He ended up purchasing the first watch he was sent to try from Eleven James. He owned a Cartier watch his wife bought him before, and didn't think he needed to spend $10,000 on another one, until he became \"enamored with\" the Zenith watch he was borrowing.  \"I'm 46 years old. I have three kids. There aren't that many new things that I get to experience,\" he said. \"But when I get a call six times a year from a concierge saying, 'what kind of watch do you want?' that's something to look forward to.\"  Eleven James also avoids the regret that often comes with make a big watch purchase. Eric Wind, a contributor to the online watch magazine Hodinkee, said that many people lament that they didn't know that much about watches or didn't know what they would like when they bought an expensive watch, and then they're stuck with it.  \"Watch tastes typically evolve over time and the luxury watch rental services provide users with that commodity of time -- literally,\" he said.

Not long after the on-air incident, Greene created an Indiegogo campaign to raise funding ahead of the state's November 4 vote on legalizing recreational marijuana.  \"As a member of the media, I've seen the dirty campaign tricks and lies that prohibitionists have been using over the past several months to sway Alaskan voters firsthand,\" she wrote in a statement on the funding site.

{"text": "Executives and anchors from the country's five biggest television networks met with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower on Monday afternoon. And they got an earful.  Trump vented about media coverage, according to sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He was highly critical of CNN and other news organizations.  But while Trump showed disdain for the news media, he also answered questions; listened to the journalists' arguments about the importance of access; and committed to making improvements.  A source in the room told CNNMoney that there was \"real progress\" made with regards to media access to Trump and his administration.  One specific topic was the importance of the \"press pool,\" a small group of journalists that traditionally travels with the president.  The hour-long meeting was off the record, meaning the participants agreed not to talk about the substance of the conversations.  But Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, who arranged the meeting, said afterward that it was \"very cordial, candid and honest.\"  While there was \"no need to mend fences,\" she said, \"from my own perspective, it is great to hit the reset button, it was a long, hard-fought campaign.\"  Some of the attendees were struck by Trump's anti-media posture. During the meeting, Trump revived some of the specific arguments he made weeks before winning the presidency.  According to Politico, among Trump's complaints, even as he asked for a \"cordial\" relationship, was that NBC had used unflattering pictures of him.  But one of the participants told CNNMoney that Trump also asked for a positive relationship between his White House and the media. The participant said that a New York Post account -- which had a source describing it as Trump giving the assembled members of the media a \"dressing down\" like a \"firing squad\" -- was overstated.  Conway herself has also criticized the Post report.  Notably, she declined to say when the president-elect would hold a news conference. \"Soon\" was the only answer.  Presidents-elect typically hold a news conference within days of being elected. Trump was elected almost two weeks ago and has not taken questions in that setting yet.  However, he has been interviewed on the CBS newsmagazine \"60 Minutes,\" and he answered a few shouted questions from reporters over the weekend. He will also be speaking with reporters from The New York Times on Tuesday.  Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. \"and others are meeting with the President Elect tomorrow at the request of his team,\" the Times said in a statement Monday afternoon. \"There will be a small, off the record meeting first, followed by an on the record session with Times reporters and editorial columnists.\"  President Obama and other government officials occasionally hold off the record sessions with reporters, anchors and other media bigwigs. Obama, for example, talked off the record with the reporters traveling with him on the way home from Peru on Sunday night.  By going off the record and giving up the right to quote the public official, the reporters gain candid insights. Both the journalists and the politicians can speak more bluntly.  Some top network anchors are traveling or on vacation this week, and thus were unable to attend Monday's meeting. But many others were present.  NBC's Chuck Todd and Lester Holt; CNN's Wolf Blitzer and Erin Burnett; CBS's Norah O'Donnell, Charlie Rose, John Dickerson, and Gayle King; and ABC's George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz were some of the anchors seen entering Trump Tower shortly before 1 p.m.  Several executives from the network news divisions were also spotted on the way into Trump Tower, including ABC News president James Goldston; CNN president Jeff Zucker; Fox News co-presidents Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy; NBC News president Deborah Turness; MSNBC president Phil Griffin; and CBS News vice president Chris Isham.  There was much for the group to talk about. Trump has long-standing relationships with many in the TV news business -- but he also waged an anti-media crusade during his campaign for president.

As legalization has increased, so have sales. In 2013, the industry was at $1.8 billion.  In 2015, it was estimated at $5.4 billion (accounting for evolving business models), according to the ArcView Group, a cannabis-focused investment and research firm.  \"The cannabis industry is so new that there are very few barriers to get in, especially for women,\" said Giadha DeCarcer, CEO and founder of New Frontier, which provides data analysis for the marijuana industry.  More importantly, she said the marijuana industry isn't as heavily skewed toward men as many other industries. It's what personally appealed to DeCarcer, a former investment banker and consultant in technology and defense.  \"Those are all heavily male dominated areas. It was the biggest frustration for me,\" she said. \"It made it harder to rise to the top.\"  DeCarcer launched New Frontier in 2014.

That far surpasses the 22% national average for women in executive roles across all industries, according to Pew Research Center.   Finding the overall number of female cannabis entrepreneurs is harder to come by. But the anecdotal evidence is strong that more women are getting a foot in the door.  Jane West is at the forefront of this trend.  West, \"a proud cannabis user,\" cofounded Women Grow, a professional networking group for women in cannabis. Its first event in 2014 had 70 attendees. Now it has chapters in 44 cities, with 21,000 subscribers to its weekly newsletter and 30,000 followers on Instagram.  The Women Grow summit kicks off February 3 in Denver. West expects the three-day event to have more than 1,500 attendees this year, including singer-songwriter, Melissa Etheridge.  \"There is nothing but opportunity for women in this industry. We need to spread the word,\" said West. \"Women are coming up with terrific business ideas. Many of them are driven by their advocacy for legal marijuana.\"  Related: The women of marijuana  Salwa Ibrahim has been an advocate of legal marijuana for a long time. \"I'm also from the Bay Area, which is the birthplace of the medical marijuana movement,\" she said.

It was a steep learning curve, but she made some smart moves to quickly get established.  \"I attracted the best possible talent and gave them incentives to stay and grow with the business,\" she said. Blum now sees 800 to 1,000 patients a day, and has added a cultivation center, production facility and 70 employees. More than half of her staff are women.  Last month, her business was acquired by Terra Tech Corp (TRTC). Ibrahim is staying on as executive director and adding two dispensaries in Las Vegas and one in Reno.

During an event in San Francisco, CEO Tim Cook and other executives announced key details about the Apple Watch, including when it will go on sale, where it will be available, and exactly how much it costs.

The Watch will be available to customers in nine markets, including the U.S. The others are Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United Kingdom.  3. The cheapest Apple Watch -- the 38mm sport model -- will cost $349, as expected. The 42mm (which is the height from top to bottom of the watch) will cost $399. The most expensive version of the Apple Watch, called the Apple Watch Edition, will start at $10,000 and cost as much as $17,000.  4. On a full charge, the Apple Watch battery should last up to 18 hours. This is critical, since the Apple Watch needs to be continuously connected to an iPhone in order to work, which can be a big battery drain.   5. The Apple Watch will be available in three models: The Apple Watch Sport, the Apple Watch and the Apple Watch Edition.   6. The watches are made from anodized aluminum (Apple Watch Sport), stainless steel (Apple Watch) and 18-karat gold (Apple Watch Edition). The Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition screens will be crafted from sapphire crystal, the same material used in luxury watches. The Apple Watch Sport will feature an Ion-X glass display.   7. There are only two buttons on the watch.   8. Each model will come in two sizes: a 38mm, or 1.5 inch (height), and 42 mm or 1.7 inch.   9. The Apple Watch needs an iPhone to connect to the Internet. And not just any iPhone -- the oldest iPhone it will connect to is the iPhone 5, and it has to be running iOS 8.2 software, which is available for download as of Monday. It connects to the iPhone via Bluetooth.   10. Each Apple Watch model will be available in two colors: Stainless steel and black stainless steel for the Apple Watch; silver aluminum and gray aluminum for the Apple Watch Sport; and 18-karat yellow gold and 18-karat rose gold for the Apple Watch Edition.   11. There are six types of wristbands: 1) a metal band with a traditional clasp 2) a rubber sport band 3) a magnetic leather band 4) a leather band with a classic buckle 5) a leather band with a modern buckle and 6) a flexible metal magnetic band.   12. You can use it to work out. The Apple Watch will have a heart rate sensor and an accelerometer to measure body movements, including step count. The watch does not have GPS, which comes as a major disappointment to fitness enthusiasts.   13. It will \"tap\" you when you have notifications. You can also tap it back, sending other Watch owners taps that can emulate a sender's heartbeat.

But in some states, not only won't you be punished -- you might be rewarded.  Kyle Sherman and Chase Wiseman cofounded Flowhub, which provides software for the cannabis industry, in 2015. The Denver-based startup has been a weed-friendly workplace from day one.  \"Our philosophy at Flowhub is to get s*** done,\" said Sherman. \"If it helps our employees get work done, then we don't care if they consume at work.\"  Sherman and Chase both consume marijuana at work, either in weekly brainstorming meetings or toward the end of the day.  \"It definitely surfaces new ideas and a fresh take on things,\" said Sherman.  While recreational marijuana is legal in Colorado, smoking of any kind isn't allowed in the building. So Flowhub's 18 employees, most of them millennials, are free to bring in cannabis-infused edibles, sodas and juices.  So far, there haven't been any negative outcomes.  \"Our clients are some of the biggest firms in the cannabis industry,\" said Sherman. \"We have to be on point with our work.

Medbox, which makes automated dispensing solutions for medications and marijuana, skyrocketed from about $8 on December 18 to $93.50 on January 8. And then it plummeted back to $33 just two days later. Today, it's right around where it started that wild ride at $11.  The case of Medbox is instructive because its market valuation of around $350 million easily makes it one of the bigger marijuana stocks. Investing veterans know that the smaller the \"market cap\" of a company, the riskier it tends to be. There are fewer shares changing hands, making it more difficult to exit a position.   Related: Investors high on marijuana despite risks  $10 billion industry? None of this is to say that the marijuana industry is doomed to fail. There are intriguing dynamics that are luring investors as more states consider legalization.  ArcView Group, a marijuana research and investment firm, estimates the legal pot business will generate $2.6 billion in revenue this year, up from $1.5 billion in 2013. The firm believes that figure could swell to over $10 billion in five years.  \"Selling marijuana is hugely profitable. Just be careful how you choose to play the industry,\" said Colas. \"Is it a good business? In the abstract, absolutely. Is it investible? That's where it gets risky.\"  Related: The job search app for the legal pot biz  Part of that risk stems from the fact that penny stocks are not held to the same regulatory standards as more traditional stocks.  Visitors to the website of American Green (AMNE), formerly The Tranzbyte Corp., are greeted by a message that warns potential investors they won't be afforded access to regular company audits. In other words, investors have to just take the medical marijuana dispensary at its word.  American Green admits that can put investors at a \"significant disadvantage from a risk standpoint.\"  Related: Want to study pot? There's a school for that  Shady activities: As you might suspect, there's also a certain level of questionable judgment involved in some corners of this market.  For example, earlier this year Resource Ventures (REVI) released a statement saying it secured the consulting services of Hemp (HEMP) to help aid its expansion plans into the medical marijuana and industrial hemp industries.  In the official statement, Resource Ventures said the deal will allow it to \"take advantage of the explosive growth and stock feeding frenzy currently occurring in the industry sector.\"  It's hard to imagine a large public company talking about a \"stock feeding frenzy\" in a public statement.  In another example, the Securities and Exchange Commission temporarily suspended trading in shares of GrowLife (PHOT) in April. The agency cited \"questions that have been raised about the accuracy and adequacy of information in the marketplace and potentially manipulative transactions\" in its shares.  Related: Tourists flock to Colorado to smoke weed  That suspension triggered GrowLife, which plans to supply equipment to marijuana growers, to default on some debt.  In a subsequent SEC filing, GrowLife highlighted a number of other risks facing its business, including the fact that it's dependent on the evolving legal landscape.  So if these penny pot stocks are too dangerous, what's an investor to do if legalization gains further steam?  \"If you begin to get a feeling that marijuana will become legal in our lives at a federal level, you probably should look at tobacco companies because they already have the manufacturing and distribution facilities,\" said Colas.

{"text": "Colorado is missing $21.5 million in pot taxes. Voters legalized retail marijuana (pot for everyone, not just medical patients) in 2012. And they were told the state would pull in $33.5 million from two new taxes in the first six months of 2014. It turns out, the projections were way off. Here's why.  Pot smokers are still buying on the black market: The state thought more people would migrate out of the black market. But only 60% of people who want pot in Colorado this year will buy it through legal channels, according to an estimate from the Marijuana Policy Group.  One big reason: Legal pot costs a lot more than illegal pot -- mostly because of taxes and fees.  Legal retail marijuana is taxed more than 27%, so it's easily cheaper on the black market.  And there's more than one way smokers are scoring pot without paying taxes.  Some are likely procuring it under the table from medical marijuana patients who buy it on the up-and-up and then resell it illegally -- depriving the state of tax revenue.  Plus, any Coloradan over 21 can grow up to six plants for personal use. If they are selling it on the black market, that's even more tax revenue the state's missing out on.  More are buying medical marijuana: Medical marijuana is taxed far less than recreational pot, to the tune of 2.9%. On average one ounce of medical marijuana costs $200, while the price of an ounce sold for recreational use is $220, but prices vary widely.  And while Coloradans must visit a doctor to get a medical marijuana card, that currently costs just $15. About 23% of the estimated marijuana users in Colorado (or 2% of the state population) have medical cards, according to the Marijuana Policy Group.  The state won't say how many more people got cards since retail pot was legalized, but the number is growing, according to state economist Larson Silbaugh.  Lawmakers were too optimistic in their revenue forecasts: State law requires the government to refund taxpayers if it collects more than expected.  Wanting to avoid returning money collected from retail marijuana sales, lawmakers made \"rosier\" projections, state lawmaker Jonathan Singer said recently.  To be fair, Colorado is in uncharted territory as the first state to legalize the drug for recreational purposes, and it's only been six months.  While lawmakers are examining the the tax structure, \"it's too early to be worried,\" said state Rep. Dan Pabon.

{"text": "Well, it's that time again. You and your closest 27 million friends and family members are flying for Thanksgiving. The crush, which started on Friday, runs through Sunday. Here's your guide to not only survive, but thrive, as you conquer the airport.  1. Leave enough time  Online check-in begins 24 hours before departure, and most airlines recommend you get to the airport no less than two hours before your scheduled departure. Bottom line: The more time you have, the more time to adjust if your plans are disrupted.  The good news is that your chances of arriving on time are better than ever. According to the Department of Transportation, airlines canceled 0.3% of scheduled domestic flights in September, the lowest rate since 1995.  2. Know your rights on overbooking  U.S. airlines have been steadily increasing capacity, but that doesn't mean your flight won't be overbooked and you may get bumped. Department of Transportation has outlined the rules that airlines have to follow when bumping passengers. Know your rights as a traveler.  3. What happens if your plans are disrupted  Download your airline's app on your phone or tablet. Many will help you find alternate flights and rebookings. Ultimately you can skip waiting in line at the airport or hanging on hold over the phone.  You can call in outside help, too. Cranky Concierge, a service run by travel expert and airline blogger Brett Snyder, can monitor your travels, watching for delays and prepare alternate flight options.  4. Charge your batteries  Many airlines now offer in-seat power, but make sure your devices are charged before you fly. And if you want to be an airport superhero, pack a power strip.  Many older aircraft have also gotten new seats with power and in-flight entertainment screens.  5. Keep entertained  Wifi internet access is now available on most U.S. mainline flights for an added fee and free on airlines like JetBlue Airways (JBLU). While internet may cost you, airlines like American (AAL), Southwest (LUV), Delta (DAL) and United offer on-board servers that stream content to your devices for free.  You can typically get access to free -- or paid -- streaming content with an airline's app. Access to streaming services on airlines like American and Alaska Airlines are offered through the Gogo In-Flight Entertainment App.  If all else fails, raise that window shade and enjoy the view. Or strike up a conversation with your seatmate, just don't talk about politics.  6. Be good to each other  I'll leave you with this. Be good to your fellow travelers, airline and airport staff. While they, too, may be grumpy from a constant onslaught of travel madness, a smile goes a long, long way.  Safe travels.

{"text": "India has plunged into a homemade crisis over the past few weeks after the government banned the country's two biggest bank notes. Banks are short of cash, low earners are struggling and the economy has been hit.  If you're just catching up to the story, here's what you need to know.  1. What happened?   In an unscheduled speech on primetime TV on Nov. 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that all 500 and 1,000 rupee notes would cease to be legal tender just four hours later. The abrupt move stunned the South Asian nation, with over 23 billion notes -- or 80% of the country's cash -- suddenly rendered \"worthless pieces of paper.\"  Modi's bombshell was followed about an hour later by an announcement that a redesigned 500 rupee note, and a new 2,000 rupee note, would be issued.  Indians were given until Dec. 30 to trade their old rupees for the new cash, or deposit them in into a bank account. Then, on Nov. 24, the government banned cash exchanges except at a few Reserve Bank of India branches.  2. Why did Modi take such a big gamble?   It's all about cracking down on \"black money,\" illicit funds earned from corruption or tax evasion and stashed away in cash. Modi also said the ban would help combat fake currency.  India loses hundreds of billions of dollars in unpaid tax every year, and only about 2% of Indians pay any income tax at all.  But in a country where 90% of transactions are conducted in cash, the initiative has caused huge disruption. Officials have urged people to bear the short term pain, arguing it will help the Indian economy in the long run.  Related: Want to beat India's cash crunch? Get married!  3. What were the consequences?  Long lines outside banks and ATMs. Millions of Indians have been waiting for hours to get their hands on cash they can still use. When they get to the front of the line, there are limits on how much they can withdraw.  There's a shortage of the new notes, and working ATMs. Those that are operational need to be refitted before they can dispense the new notes -- a process officials say will take a couple of weeks.  Until that is complete, most ATMs are stocked with 100 rupee ($1.50) notes, and are emptying as fast as they can be filled.  People who do get their hands on the 2,000 rupee ($30) notes are finding it hard to spend them, because few small traders have enough change.  4. How has India reacted?   The decision was widely hailed as a \"bold move\" on Indian social media, and seems to have widespread support even among those standing in line.  Opposition politicians are furious, however. The first two days of India's winter session of parliament were marked by protests and heated arguments over the note ban.  And public anger has begun to rise as low earners, and farming communities, see their incomes plunge. The vast majority of Indians don't have bank accounts and they rely on being paid cash to meet their daily needs.  Related: One bank's response to India's cash crisis is an ATM bus  5. What happens next?   Modi has urged the public to give him until the end of the year to get things back on track. He says the cash swap is part of a bigger strategy to modernize India's rapidly growing economy.  The government has already been forced to make several concessions, allowing institutions such as hospitals, pharmacies and gas stations to accept the old notes until Dec.15.  Officials continue to insist that the frustration and panic will die down once banks have completed the switch to the new notes.

{"text": "India has discontinued its two largest rupee notes in a shocking move against corruption. Notes worth 500 and 1,000 rupees will be invalid starting at midnight local time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced during a televised address to the nation.  The unexpected move is designed to fight against corruption and money laundering, Modi said, calling them \"diseases\" and \"obstacles\" to the country's economic success.  Modi said that policy changes had largely failed to root out corruption. Two years ago, he said, India was ranked 100th in terms of global corruption perception, and the country has only improved to 76th.  Related: India's tax dodgers still hiding hundreds of billions  The idea is that Indians who have stockpiled undeclared income will now be forced to come out of the shadows.  \"This step will strengthen the hands of the common man in the fight against corruption, black money and fake currency,\" said Modi, who leads the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.   But the ban could also spark a mad scramble as ordinary Indians seek to exchange or deposit their cash. Modi said citizens have 50 days to deposit at banks and post offices. Hospitals will be allowed to accept the banned notes for another three days, until Nov. 11.  That transition will not be an easy task. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) estimates that there are 16.5 billion 500 rupee notes and 6.7 billion 1000 rupee notes currently in circulation. ATMs will be shut on Nov. 9 and 10 to help implement the change.  Related: India's new central banker serves up surprise interest rate cut  The central bank is also preparing to issue a new series of 500 and 2,000 rupee notes, which are slated to enter circulation by Nov. 10.  Until then, the largest legal bill in circulation will be the 100 rupee note, which is worth only $1.50.   In a country where taxi drivers and shopkeepers are already reluctant to part with small bills, the sudden policy change could complicate business transactions in the short term.  Indian social media users widely praised the decision, calling it a \"bold move.\" There were also, inevitably, plenty of jokes.    India is believed to have lost out on over $100 billion in uncollected tax, a large percentage of which is illegally stashed offshore.  Only 2% of Indians pay any income tax at all because most people work in the economy's informal sector that includes jobs such as construction laborers and road side food sellers.  Modi also touted the move as an anti-terrorism measure, saying that \"enemies across the border have run their operations using fake currency notes,\" a reference to neighboring Pakistan.  \"The 500 and 1,000 rupee notes hoarded by anti-national and anti-social elements will become just worthless pieces of paper,\" he said.

{"text": "India's promise not to prosecute tax dodgers if they reveal their wealth has persuaded very few to come clean. More than $9.8 billion in previously undisclosed income was netted during a four-month amnesty that expired Friday. That could translate into $4 billion in extra revenue for the government.  But the amount of money disclosed is a tiny fraction of the tax India should be getting from its 1.3 billion citizens.  According to a report by India's state auditors, the government failed to collect over $105 billion in 2014-2015, 96% of which it labeled \"difficult to recover.\"  Then there's the money that Indians have stashed away overseas. Government officials and international research groups have estimated that figure at more than $500 billion.

{"text": "Banks are out of cash. ATMs are broken. Frustration has given way to anger. Five days ago India suddenly banned more than 80% of its rupee notes, launching a currency exchange program that has been dogged by logistics snafus, poor banking infrastructure and intense demand for the new money.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said last week the ban on old 500 and 1,000 rupee notes would strike a blow against corruption and tax evasion. The shock move has been hailed by supporters as a \"masterstroke.\"  Citizens rushed to swap the banned notes -- India's largest -- for new bills issued by the Reserve Bank of India.  But demand has overwhelmed the country's banks, which stayed open over the weekend in an attempt to process more transactions. On Monday, lines to exchange money were again thousands deep and anger was mounting.  There have been reports of scuffles, and some outraged customers have smashed ATM screens.  \"There will be a lot of trouble ahead if things don't go back to normal soon,\" said Sanjay Padole, who said he had been waiting to withdraw money for more than three hours when he spoke to CNNMoney.  Related: India scraps its two largest rupee notes in shocking anti-corruption move   The pain has been particularly intense because cash is used for 98% of consumer transactions, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. The country of 1.3 billion has just 200,000 ATMs -- and roughly half of those are broken.  \"If 10 people withdraw money then the cash gets over,\" said Sunil Chadha, 54, who was waiting in line at an ATM in New Delhi. \"The government's decision is good, but they haven't backed it up with a plan of action.\"  New notes too small for ATMs   The new 500 and 2,000 rupee notes are narrower and shorter than the old bills, meaning ATMs must be \"recalibrated\" \u2014 a procedure that will take at least two weeks to be implemented nationwide.  Officials said the first of the recalibrated ATMs will stock the new notes within the next couple of days. Until then, the largest bill Indians can get from an ATM is the 100 rupee note, worth just $1.50.  There's another problem: In a country where everyday transactions typically involve just a few hundred rupees, many people are finding the new 2,000 rupee note to be of little use.  \"No one takes them, and [those shops] that do want us to spend the entire 2,000 rupees,\" said Manoranjan Thatoi, who manages construction workers. \"That's also a huge problem, because we never spend more than 500.\"  $37 billion in cash drained from economy  The cash squeeze is huge. Government figures show that around 3 trillion rupees ($44 billion) in 500 and 1,000 rupee notes were deposited into the banking system over the past four days. About 500 billion rupees ($7 billion) have been withdrawn.  The government has urged citizens to put up with the \"temporary inconvenience\" in return for long term benefits to the Indian economy. It has also tweaked the exchange program.  The number of rupees Indians can exchange each day has increased to 4,500 rupees from 4,000. The amount they can withdraw from ATMs has also been increased to 2,500 rupees per day from 2,000. Government hospitals, railways and utility providers have been told to honor the old notes until Nov. 24.  Related: Millions line up at Indian banks to swap rupee notes   Expat Indians may have to return  The exchange program has also left Indians abroad in the lurch.

Expats hoping to swap notes could be forced to return to India, or send an authorized representative with the cash.  \"Because of some rich people, everyone suffers,\" said Sushil Jadhwani of 7 Star Money Exchange, which is based in Hong Kong.  The prime minister, however, sees it differently.  \"The poor are sleeping peacefully,\" Modi said in a speech on Monday, \"while the rich are running around trying to buy sleeping pills.\"  -- Omar Khan, Zahraa Alkhalisi and Josh Berlinger contributed reporting.

Customers in from California, Oregon and Washington to Louisiana, Massachusetts and Rhode Island have filed would-be class actions in federal courts, alleging Target was negligent and did not protect their card information.  Target (TGT) said last week that 40 million credit and debit card numbers, expiration dates and security codes had been stolen. It said it was cooperating with law enforcement and had contracted a private investigation firm. Target also said it began notifying banks, as well as \"millions\" of customers directly for whom it had email addresses.  It provided little information about how the hack took place until Monday, when spokeswoman Molly Snyder said investigators were looking at \"malware that affected Target's point-of-sale system in our U.S. stores.\" She said the company was withholding additional details at the request of law enforcement.

Judges would consider whether members of the class were similarly damaged; whether the plaintiffs are typical of and can adequately represent the class; and whether individual lawsuits would be impractical.  Target, she said, could choose to argue the plaintiffs haven't shown they were damaged by the breach.  \"You can't just sue because something happened,\" Bremner said. \"You have to have a claim and a damage.\"  And additional suits against Target could be filed in coming weeks, including some in state courts.

{"text": "Wondering what to get the gentleman on your list this holiday season? The necktie is a classic gift, and the centerpiece in men's fashion today.  To look sharp and professional, there are a few signature ties every man should own, says Alex Wilcox, owner of Lord Willy's, a British men's clothing shop in New York City. Consider adding one of these to your shopping list.  Navy tie  The first is a tie in a deep blue color. It's a standby because a navy tie works just as well with a grey suit as a plaid one.  \"The beauty of a deep navy tie is that it's going to allow all the other colors [around it] to breathe,\" says Wilcox. \"The tie itself is the grounding element and the other fabrics breathe around it.\"  Colored tie  A solid-colored tie is another must. But, \"choose your colors wisely,\" Wilcox advises.  The trick is to select colors that complement the skin tone.  For someone \"a little pink in skin color, the dark reds are going to bring that out,\" he says. For someone with olive-toned skin, \"great colors like chocolates or dark greens or purples are going to look beautiful,\" he adds.  Silk knitted tie  A simple black, navy or dark knitted tie is another good choice. It should be about 2 1/2\" wide.  \"They add a casual, relaxed flair to a shirt at the weekend -- or even during the week with a suit,\" says Wilcox. \"It's like 'sort-of-wearing-a-tie.' \"  But keep it classic and get it from an old-school vendor, Wilcox advises.  Graphic tie  Another great option is the graphic tie, Wilcox says. Paired with the right suit, it offers another way for a gentleman to express himself besides color.  Tempted by ties with little airplanes or monkeys or bananas on them? They may be cute, but better to avoid those, says Wilcox. They'll always look like a Christmas gift.  \"Not crazy about that kind of thing,\" he says.

To keep things simple and classy, it's best to make -- or order -- one of a few signature drinks, says Derrick Turner, head bartender at Harding's, an upscale restaurant and bar in New York City.  The Old Fashioned  The first is an Old Fashioned. It's easy to make, and only takes 4 ingredients.  Start with a sugar cube, 5 dashes of Angostura bitters, and a little soda water. Make a nice little paste in your glass, then \"get your muddler, just muddle it out\" until you get granulation, Turner says.   Don't have a muddler? No worries: Just use a teaspoon of granulated sugar instead of the cube.  Add 2 ounces of bourbon, stir, and you're done.  It's perfect for a night with your buddies, Turner says. \"Nice dinner, nice steak, Old Fashioned.\"  The Manhattan  The Manhattan is a bit more complicated than an Old Fashioned, but it's an elegant, classic drink, says Turner.  To make one at home, take 3 dashes of Angostura and 3 dashes of Peychaud's bitters, then put in a half ounce of sweet vermouth, and 2 ounces of rye whiskey.  Just be sure to use quality liquor, Turner advises. The drink is spirit-heavy so \"you taste your vermouth, you taste your rye,\" he says. \"You taste everything.\"  Tom Collins  The Tom Collins is \"the best drink you can make that's most versatile in my opinion,\" says Turner.  It's a simple mix of a half ounce of simple syrup, a half ounce of lemon juice, 2 ounces of gin, and soda water.  But you can do anything to a Tom Collins, Turner says. You can add lavender or mint. Instead of regular syrup, try agave or honey. Or trade lemon juice for something seasonal like blood orange. Let strawberries macerate at the bottom and you have a Strawberry Tom Collins. Add champagne and it's a French 75. Garnish with cherry, a lemon, or both.  \"It's a fun cocktail to know,\" he says. \"You can really play with [it].\"  It's great for gentlemen or ladies, and you can drink it with a straw, Turner says. It's \"lemonade on steroids.\"  The Vesper  The Vesper is an easy drink to make, and handy to know, says Turner. It's \"the yang to the yin of the Manhattan,\" he says. \"Keeping this cocktail in your back pocket is always a sure way to impress your guest.\"  Just combine 3/4 ounce of vodka, 2 ounces of gin and a 1/2 ounce of Lillet Blonde in a coupe glass. Garnish with a lemon peel and you're done.  It's \"almost too good, too simple, to be so damn tasty,\" he says.

Bank branches across the country reopened on Thursday after a surprise one-day shutdown to allow them to stockpile the new 500 and 2,000 rupee notes.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi abruptly banned the old 500 and 1,000 rupee notes in an unscheduled speech on Tuesday night.

{"text": "Banks are out of cash. ATMs are broken. Frustration has given way to anger. Five days ago India suddenly banned more than 80% of its rupee notes, launching a currency exchange program that has been dogged by logistics snafus, poor banking infrastructure and intense demand for the new money.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said last week the ban on old 500 and 1,000 rupee notes would strike a blow against corruption and tax evasion. The shock move has been hailed by supporters as a \"masterstroke.\"  Citizens rushed to swap the banned notes -- India's largest -- for new bills issued by the Reserve Bank of India.  But demand has overwhelmed the country's banks, which stayed open over the weekend in an attempt to process more transactions. On Monday, lines to exchange money were again thousands deep and anger was mounting.  There have been reports of scuffles, and some outraged customers have smashed ATM screens.  \"There will be a lot of trouble ahead if things don't go back to normal soon,\" said Sanjay Padole, who said he had been waiting to withdraw money for more than three hours when he spoke to CNNMoney.  Related: India scraps its two largest rupee notes in shocking anti-corruption move   The pain has been particularly intense because cash is used for 98% of consumer transactions, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. The country of 1.3 billion has just 200,000 ATMs -- and roughly half of those are broken.  \"If 10 people withdraw money then the cash gets over,\" said Sunil Chadha, 54, who was waiting in line at an ATM in New Delhi. \"The government's decision is good, but they haven't backed it up with a plan of action.\"  New notes too small for ATMs   The new 500 and 2,000 rupee notes are narrower and shorter than the old bills, meaning ATMs must be \"recalibrated\" \u2014 a procedure that will take at least two weeks to be implemented nationwide.  Officials said the first of the recalibrated ATMs will stock the new notes within the next couple of days. Until then, the largest bill Indians can get from an ATM is the 100 rupee note, worth just $1.50.  There's another problem: In a country where everyday transactions typically involve just a few hundred rupees, many people are finding the new 2,000 rupee note to be of little use.  \"No one takes them, and [those shops] that do want us to spend the entire 2,000 rupees,\" said Manoranjan Thatoi, who manages construction workers. \"That's also a huge problem, because we never spend more than 500.\"  $37 billion in cash drained from economy  The cash squeeze is huge. Government figures show that around 3 trillion rupees ($44 billion) in 500 and 1,000 rupee notes were deposited into the banking system over the past four days. About 500 billion rupees ($7 billion) have been withdrawn.  The government has urged citizens to put up with the \"temporary inconvenience\" in return for long term benefits to the Indian economy. It has also tweaked the exchange program.  The number of rupees Indians can exchange each day has increased to 4,500 rupees from 4,000. The amount they can withdraw from ATMs has also been increased to 2,500 rupees per day from 2,000. Government hospitals, railways and utility providers have been told to honor the old notes until Nov. 24.  Related: Millions line up at Indian banks to swap rupee notes   Expat Indians may have to return  The exchange program has also left Indians abroad in the lurch. By Monday, expatriates in cities such as Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi had all but given up trying to trade in their canceled notes.  \"We stopped buying or selling these 500 or 1,000 notes right from the night the announcement came through,\" said Sudhir Kumar Shetty, president of Abu Dhabi-based currency trading firm UAE Exchange.  Expats hoping to swap notes could be forced to return to India, or send an authorized representative with the cash.  \"Because of some rich people, everyone suffers,\" said Sushil Jadhwani of 7 Star Money Exchange, which is based in Hong Kong.  The prime minister, however, sees it differently.  \"The poor are sleeping peacefully,\" Modi said in a speech on Monday, \"while the rich are running around trying to buy sleeping pills.\"  -- Omar Khan, Zahraa Alkhalisi and Josh Berlinger contributed reporting.

{"text": "India has discontinued its two largest rupee notes in a shocking move against corruption. Notes worth 500 and 1,000 rupees will be invalid starting at midnight local time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced during a televised address to the nation.  The unexpected move is designed to fight against corruption and money laundering, Modi said, calling them \"diseases\" and \"obstacles\" to the country's economic success.  Modi said that policy changes had largely failed to root out corruption. Two years ago, he said, India was ranked 100th in terms of global corruption perception, and the country has only improved to 76th.  Related: India's tax dodgers still hiding hundreds of billions  The idea is that Indians who have stockpiled undeclared income will now be forced to come out of the shadows.  \"This step will strengthen the hands of the common man in the fight against corruption, black money and fake currency,\" said Modi, who leads the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.   But the ban could also spark a mad scramble as ordinary Indians seek to exchange or deposit their cash. Modi said citizens have 50 days to deposit at banks and post offices. Hospitals will be allowed to accept the banned notes for another three days, until Nov. 11.  That transition will not be an easy task. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) estimates that there are 16.5 billion 500 rupee notes and 6.7 billion 1000 rupee notes currently in circulation. ATMs will be shut on Nov. 9 and 10 to help implement the change.  Related: India's new central banker serves up surprise interest rate cut  The central bank is also preparing to issue a new series of 500 and 2,000 rupee notes, which are slated to enter circulation by Nov. 10.  Until then, the largest legal bill in circulation will be the 100 rupee note, which is worth only $1.50.   In a country where taxi drivers and shopkeepers are already reluctant to part with small bills, the sudden policy change could complicate business transactions in the short term.  Indian social media users widely praised the decision, calling it a \"bold move.\" There were also, inevitably, plenty of jokes.    India is believed to have lost out on over $100 billion in uncollected tax, a large percentage of which is illegally stashed offshore.  Only 2% of Indians pay any income tax at all because most people work in the economy's informal sector that includes jobs such as construction laborers and road side food sellers.  Modi also touted the move as an anti-terrorism measure, saying that \"enemies across the border have run their operations using fake currency notes,\" a reference to neighboring Pakistan.  \"The 500 and 1,000 rupee notes hoarded by anti-national and anti-social elements will become just worthless pieces of paper,\" he said.

{"text": "Colorado residents could see some green in their pockets thanks to the new recreational marijuana taxes. Budget advisers to the state legislature crunched the numbers and revealed the state could be forced to refund as much as $100 million to taxpayers.  The state's Taxpayer Bill of Rights, known as TABOR, sets limits on taxes and government spending. If the government collects more than expected, it generally owes taxpayers a refund.  But Colorado taxpayers shouldn't expect a refund check in the mail. The state has several other procedures to handle a refund.  The state could provide taxpayers a credit on the next year's tax bill, for example, or reduce the sales tax.  Related: Colorado collects millions in first month of legal marijuana  Colorado is authorized to collect about $70 million in recreational marijuana taxes. But estimates show how the state could easily collect far more in the fiscal year that begins in July.  If initial calculations end up being accurate, the state could owe taxpayers a $67 million. Another estimate puts the amount at $107 million. But it's also possible the state will collect less than $70 million, or that voters could allow the state to keep any extra money.  \"This would just strike me as completely bizarre,\" State Senator Pat Steadman as staffers explained how the state could collect so much more than initially expected. He called the situation \"frustrating.\"  But fellow Democratic State Senator Crisanta Duran pointed out, \"It has been the will of the people to vote for TABOR and we have this.\"  Related: Want a job?

The ultimate amount -- and whether there will be a refund at all -- won't be known until the coming fiscal year closes in June 2015.  Recreational marijuana first went on sale in Colorado at the beginning of January. That month, the industry brought in about $2 million in tax revenue.

{"text": "Throughout the campaign, Donald Trump held up America's airports as a symbol of the nation's decay. \"You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark,\" Trump said during the first presidential debate. \"We've become a third world country.\"  Newly built airports and passenger terminals in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and China were the envy of the world, he said. The three nations continue to invest heavily in their state-owned and funded airlines and aviation systems.  No U.S. airport receives a five-star rating from SkyTrax, a respected airline and airport rating and review group. There are only three four-star airports: San Francisco, Houston-Hobby and Cincinnati.  The quality of U.S. airports receive low marks from both sides of the political aisle. Vice President Joe Biden also described LaGuardia Airport as \"like a third world country.\" That airport is already undergoing a more than $5 billion modernization.  9 reasons travelers hate LaGuardia Airport  The U.S. \"was built on a world class infrastructure system,\" said Roger Dow, president of the U.S. Travel Association. \"We fell asleep in the '70 and '80s\" as Asian airports were developed. The United States looks like it's falling behind, he said.  As part of his plan for his first 100 days, unveiled in October, Trump has proposed a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure and energy projects over a decade, focusing on U.S. roads, bridges and airports.  \"We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it,\" he said in his victory speech in the early hours of Wednesday.  World's best airports for 2016 announced  Still, fixing American airports won't be easy. Improving the facilities is not as easy as directly committing new federal dollars and requires a change in how airports are funded in the U.S., say aviation experts.  Airport funding breaks down into three broad categories.  The first, the federally funded Airport Improvement Program, goes to safety- and operations-related improvements to runways, taxiways and aprons where aircraft park. This program funded the system that prevented Vice President-elect Mike Pence's plane from careening onto the highway near LaGuardia one night in late October.  Thanks to these kinds of investments -- totaling $3.2 billion this year -- America has among the safest airports in the world. That's critical to safe and seamless travel in the U.S., but cranky passengers don't see or feel the benefits in terms of their comfort.  Transforming airports won't be determined by federal funding at all, but rather a $4.50 fee on each leg of your ticket that goes directly to the airport. These fees make up the second category of funding.  How much an airport has available to spend depends on how many people are flying there.  These Passenger Facility Charges can be used for new terminals, gates, ticket counters, lobbies or ground transportation like the AirTrain system at New York's JFK.  The airport lounge: The new front line in the battle of the airlines  Airports collected $3 billion from these charges in 2015, though it's estimated that U.S. airports required $15 billion to support infrastructure improvements.  The fees haven't increased since 2000, and many of the trade associations for tourism and airports favor an increase to $8.50.  The Airports Council International North America last year identified 30 major projects that could be funded with an increase, but they are unglamorous jobs like terminal expansions and elevators.  Will you get to enjoy fancy restaurants, shops, modern parking or rental car facilities? Neither Trump nor traveler fees can help there. Those kinds of improvements are funded by the airlines and other businesses.

{"text": "The publication of the Panama Papers sent shock waves around the world. The reports by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which CNNMoney hasn't been able to independently verify, allege that top officials around the world hid wealth through secret offshore companies.  Related: Law firm at the heart of the scandal  The investigation is based on over 11 million emails, documents and client records allegedly obtained from Mossack Fonseca, a law firm based in Panama.  Here is what you need to know about the scandal:  What's the latest?  British Prime Minister David Cameron has admitted that he and his wife profited from shares they had in a Panama-based trust set up by his late father. Cameron told CNN affiliate ITV News that he owned shares of the trust that he sold in January 2010, a few months before becoming prime minister, for about \u00a330,000 ($42,200).  Cameron said he paid tax on the dividends and had nothing to hide. His comments follow reports based on the Mossack Fonseca documents suggesting his father used the law firm to help his offshore trust avoid paying any British taxes.  Big banks and other financial companies in the U.K. have been given a little over a week to disclose any links with Mossack Fonseca to the country's financial regulator. The request from the regulator follows reports that several big banks, including UBS, Credit Suisse and HSBC, allegedly helped their clients hide cash in offshore companies. The banks denied the allegations on Tuesday.  A review of state business registration documents showed the law firm also helped to create more than 1,000 companies in the United States, through its Las Vegas-based subsidiary MF Corporate Services.  The publication of the ICIJ reports sparked a government crisis in Iceland, where the Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned on Tuesday. The reports revealed alleged links to an offshore company with holdings in Iceland's collapsed banks, triggering mass protests in the country's capital.  Related: The murky world of offshore tax havens  In China, online censors have been restricting search results and discussions on social media involving the terms \"Panama Papers\" and \"Panama.\" They're also blocking use of the names of relatives of current and former Chinese leaders mentioned in the reports -- including President Xi Jinping.  Meanwhile, governments in the U.K., France, Belgium, Australia and Mexico have pledged to investigate the information for possible cases of tax evasion.  Who is implicated in the documents?  The documents reference 12 current or former world leaders, as well as 128 other politicians and public officials. Allegations involve associates of Vladimir Putin (the Russian leader isn't himself mentioned by name in any of the documents); FIFA; Argentina's President Mauricio Macri; the father of British Prime Minister David Cameron; relatives of multiple Chinese officials, including three members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo, the most powerful group in the ruling Communist Party; Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko and others.  What are they saying?  Officials and public figures affected by the reports have been responding in different ways.  The Kremlin dismissed the allegations as \"a series of fibs\" aimed at discrediting Putin ahead of elections. But FIFA, the international soccer governing body, has started an investigation into a member of its ethics committee named in the reports.  The Chinese government has repeatedly declined to comment on the reports concerning relatives of its current and former top officials other than to call them \"pulled out of nowhere.\"  A spokesperson for Argentina's Macri said the president had never owned a stake in the firm he was linked to.  Poroshenko dismissed the claims, saying he \"might be the first top official in Ukraine who treats declaring of assets, paying taxes, conflict of interest issues seriously.\"  Is setting up a shell company or an offshore account illegal?  Not necessarily. There are legitimate reasons to set up a shell company -- for example to run an international business. But shell companies and offshore accounts can be used to hide the real origin of money and can be used for money laundering.  The ICIJ reports claim that Mossack Fonseca's clients included at least 33 people and companies blacklisted by the U.S. government because of links to drug trafficking and terrorism.  Who is Mossack Fonseca?  The Panama-based law firm specializes in helping clients incorporate firms in offshore jurisdictions. It has been in business for 30 years and has set up more than 240,000 offshore companies for clients from 200 countries and territories, according to the ICIJ.  The report described Mossack Fonseca as \"one of the world's five biggest wholesalers of offshore secrecy.\"  Mossack Fonseca has around 40 offices globally, including several in mainland China and others in countries and regions identified as tax havens by the European Commission, such as the Bahamas, British Virgin Islands, Seychelles, and Anguilla.  Related: What's ICIJ?  Ramon Fonseca, co-founder of the firm, told CNN that the information published about the firm was false. In a statement, the firm said it had done nothing wrong, and the reports would create confusion about offshore finance.  In a statement to CNN, the firm denied that many of the people named by the reports were its clients. It also has claimed the documents were taken in an external hack.  Why does this matter?  The bombshell report comes at a time of growing pressure to crack down on global tax evasion and money laundering.  International organizations have agreed new transparency rules, and politicians are stepping up their calls for the rich to start paying their fair share of taxes.  The Panama Papers revealed the huge scale of offshore finance.  Why Panama?  The International Monetary Fund said two years ago that Panama's open economy, strategic location and developed offshore financial services sector put the country at a high risk of being used for money laundering.  The central American country was until February on an international watch list of countries with weak anti-money laundering laws. It remains on the European Commission's blacklist of tax haven and non-cooperative jurisdictions.  \"Panama is the last major holdout that continues to allow funds to be hidden offshore from tax and law enforcement authorities,\" said Angel Gurr\u00eda, secretary general of the OECD, in a statement Monday.  -- Charles Riley, Chris Liakos, and Alanna Petroff contributed to this report.

The country's wedding season reaches its peak this month and next, and most are paid for in cash. Tough limits on withdrawals of new 500 and 2,000 rupee notes were causing havoc.  Now there's relief for millions of happy couples: The government on Thursday relaxed those limits for people with a wedding in the family. They will be allowed a one-time withdrawal of 250,000 rupees ($3,700) -- more than 10 times the current weekly limit of 24,000.  \"It can be withdrawn either from the account of the father or the mother... or those who are getting married,\" Shaktikanta Das, a senior official in the finance ministry, said in a statement.  The catch? Only one withdrawal per family will be allowed, and officials will require the person making it to sign a declaration to that effect.  India witnesses a sharp spike in the number of weddings every November and December, a period Hindus believe is a good time to get married.

Raj Kumar (no relation) also said he was struggling to make payments for his sister's upcoming wedding at the end of the month.  \"Maybe... Narendra Modi will do something,\" he told CNNMoney last week.  But with banks and ATMs witnessing huge lines and cash shortages for the eighth straight day, getting the money out will still be a challenge.  And the cost of many Indian weddings will far exceed the new relaxed limit. One particularly extravagant five-day affair in southern India this week, the wedding of a mining tycoon's daughter in Bangalore, reportedly cost about $75 million \u2014 including over 3,000 bouncers and samba dancers flown in from Brazil.

{"text": "India's chaotic move to replace most of its cash could slam the brakes on its red hot economy. The country overtook China as the world's fastest growing major economy this year, but may fall behind again as the withdrawal of big rupee notes hurts business activity.  Analysts estimate India's shock decision to scrap its 500 rupee and 1,000 rupee notes -- accounting for about 86% of cash in circulation -- will shave at least 1% (and possibly much more) off India's current GDP growth rate of 7.1%.  \"A 3% dip in the growth rate [for the current financial year] wouldn't surprise me,\" Pronab Sen, India's former chief statistician, told CNNMoney. Sen is country director for India at the International Growth Centre in London.  If that happens, India would almost certainly lose its crown to bigger rival China.  Related: How fast are India and China really growing?  \"The impact on GDP growth is clearly going to be negative in the short run,\" said Thomas Rookmaaker of Fitch Ratings.  How big a hit the economy will suffer \"depends to a large extent on how long the cash crunch is going to take,\" Rookmaaker added.  No end in sight  It doesn't show signs of ending anytime soon. According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), over 5 trillion rupees ($74 billion) in old cash has been sucked out of the economy since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's abrupt announcement on Nov. 8.  So far, only 1 trillion rupees ($15 billion) have been replaced by new 500 and 2,000 notes -- equivalent to just 7% of the value of the defunct cash. The new notes are too small for ATMs, and refitting the machines will take weeks.  The Indian government has given people 50 days -- until Dec. 30 -- to exchange old notes. But daily and weekly limits apply.  Related: 5 key questions about India's cash crunch  In a country where close to 90% of transactions take place in cash, the shock will reverberate a while longer.  \"Unavailability of notes and restrictions on withdrawals have made it difficult to carry out transactions, even for those who have legitimate wealth,\" Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist for HSBC, said in a recent note.  Sectors such as retail, construction and real estate rely heavily on cash and contribute about 30% of GDP, according to the Institute of International Finance. It estimates that the hit to those areas of the economy could pull growth down by more than 2% over the next two quarters.  Rupee sinks to record low  The economic fallout helped push the rupee to a record low of 68.86 to the U.S. dollar on Thursday, despite reports that the RBI was selling dollars to stop the slide.  Modi is hoping the rupee note switch will reduce tax evasion and money laundering. It still appears to have solid support among Indian voters. And analysts say the long term impact, if coupled with further policy changes, could be good for the economy.  \"The [negative] impact might well be mitigated once the supply of the new notes has improved,\" said Shilan Shah, India economist at Capital Economics.  \"I think the impact over the longer term is probably going to be quite positive, given that it's a fairly strong reflection of the government's anti-corruption drive,\" he added.

{"text": "A day after Target announced that forty million of its customers had their credit and debit card data breached, the retailer announced a 10% discount for all shoppers at its stores this Saturday and Sunday. \"We recognize this has been confusing and disruptive during an already busy holiday season,\" Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel said in a statement Friday. \"Our guests' trust is our top priority at Target and we are committed to making this right.\"  The company also provided details Friday about the extent of the hack and the information that could have been compromised.  The nation's No. 2 general merchandise retailer said cards used at its brick-and-mortar stores between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15 of this year may have been impacted.  Target (TGT) said there is no indication that any debit card PIN numbers were compromised. The retailer also claimed it doesn't appear that the three- or four-digit security code visible on the face of credit cards were breached. That means that the debit and credit cards that were compromised cannot be used to withdraw cash from an ATM or to shop online.  Related: 4 things to do after your card has been hacked  But lawyer Robert Ahdoot, part of a legal team in California that has filed a lawsuit seeking class action status on behalf of Target customers, said he had spoken to shoppers who claimed thieves had used their debit card information to withdraw money from ATMs.  The lawsuit alleges negligence on the part of the retailer, and also says Target failed to promptly notify victims of the hack.  \"Target has an obligation to provide adequate security for the financial information they collect,\" Ahdoot said. He recommended that consumers who suspect that their cards may have been compromised change their PIN numbers as a precaution.  Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the retailer \"typically doesn't comment on pending litigation.\"  Target said it believes customers' birth dates and social security numbers weren't compromised. The retailer said it gave Visa, MasterCard (MA), Discover (DFS) and  American Express (AXP) the card numbers of those who may have been impacted, and that these companies will monitor the cards for fraud.  As a precaution, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. said it was temporarily limiting ATM withdrawals to $100 a day and purchases to $300 a day for Chase customers in the U.S. whose debit cards are at risk, the company said in a letter to affected account holders.  Meanwhile, Target is also monitoring its own card, the REDcard, for potential unauthorized activity.  Steinhafel said the affected customers \"will not be held financially responsible for any credit and debit card fraud.\"  \"[T]o provide guests with extra assurance, we will be offering free credit monitoring services,\" Steinhafel said. \"We will be in touch with those impacted by this issue soon on how and where to access the service.\"  To help answer questions about the incident, Target has set up a hotline for customers. Shoppers have been reporting long hold times, so Target said it will beef up its staffing.  Target didn't specify how its systems were hacked. But judging by the scope of the breach and the kind of information that criminals obtained, security experts say hackers apparently targeted the retailer's point-of-sale system. That means they either slipped malware into the terminals where customers swipe their credit cards, or they collected customer data while it was en route from Target to its credit card processors.  The retailer said it had notified authorities and financial institutions immediately after it was made aware of the unauthorized access, and had hired a forensics team to investigate how the breach may have occurred. The issue that allowed the breach has been identified and resolved, Snyder said.

{"text": "There's a lot to praise about the new MacBook Pro laptop. To start, it's lighter, thinner and Apple's most powerful portable computer to date. And that's already translated to sales: Pre-orders have been far greater than any other professional-grade Apple laptop to date, the company told CNNMoney.  It's also the first update to the line in four years. People have clearly been waiting for the upgrade.  While the product comes with a series of additions -- not to mention a few controversial port removals -- the main new feature worth discussing is the Touch Bar.  In lieu of the function keys typically housed above a standard keyboard, there's now a long vertical touch display. This means you can control a range of things just by using your fingertips. We're talking about everything from scrolling through emoji options and text color to easily calling up photos you want to edit to tweaking brightness and sound.  Related: See Apple's new MacBook Pro in :90  There's even a spot dedicated to TouchID, where you can log into the laptop or use Apple Pay to make an online purchase.  The updated line isn't cheap, though: a 13-inch MacBook Pro with the TouchBar costs $1,799, while the 15-inch version with the Touch Bar runs $2,399. You can also buy the 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar for much less ($1,499).  When the MacBook Pro was announced last month, it was unclear if the new bells and whistles were worth the extra money. Is it a gimmick or an actual step forward?  While the feature is useful, one thing is clear: It's part of a greater evolution toward a more touch-centric space. \"Gimmick\" isn't the right word, but neither is \"revolutionary.\" It is, however, a solid step in the right direction and unquestionably fun to play around with.  Here's a closer look at what to expect:  Touch Bar  To start, it's important to explore why Apple has taken this approach: After all, why not just go all in on a touchscreen display like Microsoft's (MSFT, Tech30) Surface Book?  Apple (AAPL, Tech30) said it was adamant about keeping the screen touch-free. Considering people use the keyboard as the primary place to do work, it wants the display to remain a space dedicated to the eyes.   Apple refers to the Touch Bar as a musical instrument of sorts, allowing you to slide and add effects to enhance performance. The feature, which illuminates when you touch it, is all about maximizing functionality. There's a lot packed into just a sliver, but it never feels crowded.  When accessing it outside of a Mac app, it serves up what you might typically find on the keyboard, such as volume and brightness tools, the escape key and access to Siri.  Related: How Pixar saved Steve Jobs and Apple  But the real sweet spot happens when you go into the Mac apps. It's deeply integrated into apps like system controls, Photos, Siri and Safari. For example, you can scroll through all the tabs you have open on the Safari browser by sliding a finger on the Touch Bar.  If you compose a message in the Mail app, the Touch Bar will highlight emoji auto-completion: By typing \"birthday,\" it will suggest confetti or a balloon.  The Touch Bar is also compatible with other third-party programs, like Skype and Microsoft Office, password manager 1Password and Photoshop (coming soon).  TouchID  TouchID, which already serves as the security gateway to the iPhone, is now available on the MacBook Pro. It's easy to program your finger -- any of your five digits will do -- through the dedicated button, located to the right of the Touch Bar. You can program up to three different fingerprints, catering to families who share one device.  TouchID also supports Apple Pay, which means online shopping is now dangerously easy. When visiting a retailer's site that supports Apple Pay -- Lululemon, Etsy and Adidas are a few early partners -- you can tap to buy whatever is in your cart.  Beyond the bells and whistles  Beyond the Touch Bar and TouchID, the device comes with an incredibly crisp retina display. The casing of the body is a stunner too -- and now available in space gray, in addition to silver.  The larger version weighs in at just four pounds; the smaller version is naturally less (three pounds). Performance is fluid, thanks to double the processing power of previous models. You can go in and out of programs in what seems like a heartbeat.   Related: Apple delays its AirPods launch  Both the 13-inch and 15-inch models pack four fast-speed Thunderbolt 3.0 ports (USB-C) and headphone jacks, despite Apple's controversial decision to remove it on the iPhone 7. There's also more space around the trackpad to provide a bigger canvas for working.  But the devices forgo an SD card slot, as well as USB and HDMI ports. This means even the latest iPhone can't plug into the MacBook Pro without an adapter -- a move that's already sparked consumer complaints.   Apple argues USB-C ports are the future, but it makes living in the now awfully difficult. Following the backlash, Apple dropped the price on dongles to make adapting to the requirement a little less costly.  The takeaway  Overall, the latest version of the MacBook Pro is all about the Touch Bar. Is the novel concept reason enough to purchase the new MacBook Pro? No. But it's a sweet bonus to arguably the best performing laptop on the market.  If you're debating whether the extra $300 for the Touch Bar and TouchID is worth it, it depends what kind of user you are. Sure, both features are handy, but they're more of a bonus than a necessity. The pricier model will also give you a faster processor and two more Thunderbolt ports (a plus if you need to connect to more displays).  Then again, if these qualifications aren't appealing and you're not doing a ton of intensive work, such as video or photo editing, you're probably better off with a cheaper MacBook Air.  Either way, the Touch Bar alone offers a glimpse at Apple's interpretation of the future of computing -- a small but exciting step forward.  The new MacBook Pro computers start shipping later this week.

{"text": "India's promise not to prosecute tax dodgers if they reveal their wealth has persuaded very few to come clean. More than $9.8 billion in previously undisclosed income was netted during a four-month amnesty that expired Friday. That could translate into $4 billion in extra revenue for the government.  But the amount of money disclosed is a tiny fraction of the tax India should be getting from its 1.3 billion citizens.  According to a report by India's state auditors, the government failed to collect over $105 billion in 2014-2015, 96% of which it labeled \"difficult to recover.\"  Then there's the money that Indians have stashed away overseas. Government officials and international research groups have estimated that figure at more than $500 billion. The Panama Papers leak detailing offshore bank accounts, published earlier this year, featured at least 500 Indians.   Moreover, only 2% of Indians pay any income tax at all because most people work in the economy's informal sector that includes jobs such as construction laborers and road side food sellers.  The tax amnesty program, known as the Income Declaration Scheme 2016, was heavily advertised over the summer. Prime Minister Narendra Modi used a radio address in June to appeal to the Indian public to take part.  This week, Modi hailed the \"successful outcome\" of the campaign on Twitter, after it was revealed that 64,275 people had declared untaxed income.

{"text": "While the tens of millions of Target shoppers who had their credit and debit card information stolen likely won't be on the hook for any fraudulent transactions that may occur, debit card users could face much bigger headaches than credit card users. That's because debit and credit cards are treated differently by consumer protection laws. Under federal law, your personal liability for fraudulent charges on a credit card can't exceed $50. But if a fraudster uses your debit card, you could be liable for $500 or more, depending on how quickly you report it.  \"I know people love their debit cards. But man oh man, they are loaded with holes when it comes to fraud,\" said John Ulzheimer, credit expert at CreditSesame.com, a credit management website.  Related: 4 things to do after your credit card has been hacked  Plus, if someone uses your credit card, the charge is often credited back to your account immediately after it's reported, Ulzheimer said.  Yet, if a crook uses your debit card, not only can they drain your bank account, but it can take up to two weeks for the bank to investigate the fraud and reimburse your account.  \"In the meantime, you might have to pay your rent, your utilities and other bills,\" said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. The organization recommends that consumers stick to credit cards as much as possible.  Related: How not to get hacked   Whichever card you decide to swipe, here are ways to protect yourself from scammers.  Be vigilant with your accounts: The Target (TGT) hack is just the latest in a long history of data breaches, and it likely won't be the last.  As a result, you should check your debit and credit account activity at least every few days and keep an eye out for any unfamiliar transactions. If you notice anything fishy, notify your bank or credit card company immediately.  \"Waiting until the end of the month to check out [your] credit card statement for fraudulent use is a relic of the past,\" Ulzheimer said. \"Fraud is a real-time crime, and we as consumers have to be constantly engaged.\"  Set your own fraud controls: Financial institutions have their own internal fraud controls, but some transactions can slip through the cracks, said Al Pascual, senior analyst of security risk and fraud at Javelin Strategy & Research.  Many financial institutions will let you set alerts for account transactions. Even better, some allow you to block transactions that are out of the ordinary for you, such as for online purchases at a certain kind of retailer or for any purchases over $500.  Related: Biggest credit card hacks  \"We believe that consumers are going to know best as to how to protect their account,\" he said. \"They know their own behaviors.  Watch out for fraud hotspots: You should be especially wary of using a debit card online and at retailers more vulnerable to fraud.  Gas stations and ATM machines are hotspots for so-called \"skimmers,\" machines that scammers install to capture your card information. Watch out for ATM parts that look unusual and always cover your hand when typing your PIN in case a camera is watching, said Shirley Inscoe, a senior analyst with the Aite Group.  Don't let your guard down: If you think your information has been compromised, don't assume everything's fine after a few months. Stolen card information is often sold to a variety of groups on the black market who may hold onto it for months or even years.  \"Many times these fraud rings will wait until the news dies down and people have forgotten about it before they use that data,\" Inscoe said. \"It may not be used until next winter, so it really is a good idea for people to monitor their activity.\" ", "date": "NA", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/20/pf/expert/debit-credit-cards/index.html", "author": "Melanie Hicken"},

{"text": "Wix wants to help boutique hotels, bed and breakfasts, and vacation rentals take control of their web presence. On Wednesday, the cloud-based web development company launched WixHotels, a booking engine that allows hotels to manage their own inventory without paying commission to one of the big aggregators like Expedia (EXPE), Orbitz (OWW) or Priceline (PCLN, Tech30).  The goal is for smaller hotel and vacation rental owners to be able to \"compete effectively with the giants of the industry,\" according to Wix (WIX) co-founder Avishai Abrahami.  Right now, hotels' online visibility relies heavily on aggregators, which can be costly for boutique businesses.  \"The high cost and commissions taken by existing booking engines and booking websites is a major factor in why users will switch to WixHotels,\" said Abrahami.  Sites like Expedia can charge as much as a 30% commission on the room price, according to hospitality expert Larry Mogelonsky.  Expedia declined requests for comment.  Related: Banks won't lend? Use these guys instead  Wix has 50 million registered users -- both businesses and individuals -- who have created their own web and mobile sites with Wix's drag and drop utilities (no coding experience required). Roughly 10,000 of Wix's customers are running hotel sites. Many rely on the costly booking aggregators -- and some have no digital booking system at all.  \"We began investigating the needs of this vertical about five months ago,\" explained Abrahami. \"When realizing the gap in the market, we began development.\"  Since its soft launch last week, he said they've already had thousands of implementations. For now, WixHotels is free to web clients, but like other Wix features, it will likely be based on a freemium model, meaning additional features will cost more. Websites through Wix end up costing customers between $7 and $50 a month, depending to the features added.  Related: Facebook says: If you Like it, Buy it.   A seamless, full-service web experience is essential in the travel industry.

He runs his website through Wix and previously had just a basic contact form and a phone number for reservations. He was one of a few hotels that helped Wix test the product during a pilot period.  \"It's all together, our site and our booking engine,\" said Techera. \"We're free to just care for our guests.\"  Techera is likely in the minority, though, according to Mogelonsky, who's skeptical of the need for Wix's product.  Mogelonsky estimates that just \".001\" of the hotel industry population don't have systems currently in place, and they're likely hotels with a very small number of rooms.  \"We don't know a person who doesn't have a property management system,\" explained Mogelonsky. \"There's no critical mass here.\" ", "date": "NA", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/08/06/smallbusiness/wix-hotel-booking/index.html", "author": "Sara Ashley O'Brien"},

{"text": "China would rather its citizens didn't talk too much about the Panama Papers. A coalition of news organizations has seized global attention with a barrage of reports based on a massive document leak from a law firm in Panama. The reports, which CNN hasn't been able to independently verify, allege top officials and people connected to them around the world hid wealth through secret offshore companies.  China's online censors are restricting many search results and discussions on social media involving the terms \"Panama Papers\" and \"Panama.\" They're also censoring use of the names of relatives of current and former Chinese leaders -- including President Xi Jinping -- that are mentioned in the reports.  At a news briefing Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei declined to comment in response to repeated questions about the reports, which he described as \"pulled out of nowhere.\"  It's not against the law to have offshore financial holdings, and the leaked documents don't necessarily indicate illegal activity. But the personal finances of Chinese leaders and their family members is a hugely sensitive issue for the ruling Communist Party, which is in the midst of a sweeping anti-corruption campaign led by Xi.  Related: A look at the group behind the Panama Papers  Chinese authorities blocked the websites of The New York Times and Bloomberg in 2012 after the news organizations published separate articles about the wealth of relatives of top leaders. China also delayed renewing visas for journalists from the two companies.  The Panama Papers have brought the wealth issue back into the spotlight again, and China appears to be using its vast censorship apparatus, known as the Great Firewall, to block information it deems sensitive.  Some media organizations inside China have carried reports, mainly in English, about the Panama Papers -- but without any mention of a Chinese connection. Some articles that covered the allegations concerning allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin have since been deleted. Moscow has dismissed the reports about the Putin associates as a \"series of fibs.\"  There was broader coverage of the Panama Papers in English-language articles published by China's official news agency, Xinhua, including the political furor caused in Iceland. But those articles aren't aimed at a domestic Chinese audience.  Related: The law firm at the heart of the Panama Papers scandal  Chinese state media also questioned the credibility of the reports and the motivation for the leak.  The Global Times, a Communist Party-affiliated tabloid, published an opinion article in both Chinese and English whose headline claimed a \"powerful force\" was behind the Panama Papers.  \"Information that is negative to the U.S. can always be minimized, while exposure of non-Western leaders, such as Putin, can get extra spin,\" the English-language version of the article said.  The group of news organizations privy to the huge trove of documents hasn't identified the source of the leak, who is reported to have first contacted the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.

It also lowered the price on its Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter from $49 to $29.  The discounts are available through the end of the year.  While it's possible to purchase low-cost adapters on Amazon and elsewhere around the web, official Apple adapters are generally better quality and more reliable than the cheaper products offered online.  The MacBook Pro isn't the only new Apple product product flooded with criticism for its dongle and accessory requirements.  In September, the iPhone 7 line killed the headphone jack in favor of wireless AirPods. An adapter is required in order to use traditional headphones with the new devices.

{"text": "Disclaimer: The following story includes major spoilers from Sunday's episode of \"Game of Thrones.\" \"Game of Thrones\" spent the lapse between seasons five and six being peppered by questions about Jon Snow's fate. Based on Sunday's extra-long finale, the producers will be spared that irritation, but anticipation for next season should be no less palpable.  \"Thrones\" is known for loading up its penultimate episode with huge, Imax-quality battle sequences, as it did last week, living up to HBO's old \"It's not TV\" slogan.  Still, the 69-minute finale Sunday was hardly a low-key exercise. Rather, it contained a major, much-discussed reveal, and advanced the story in ways that bring a possible endgame into much greater focus.  \"Game of Thrones\" is almost surely the most analyzed, parsed and theorized-about show on television -- one of the high-class problems associated with being a huge genre hit.  As a consequence, much has already been made of the ascendant role female characters have played this season. While scenes of violence toward women have triggered past controversy, this year women not only took center stage but proved every bit as ruthless and resourceful as any of the men.  Related: 'Game of Thrones' epic battle: Jon Snow vs. the most hated man on TV  In the finale, the clear theme was vengeance -- which was exacted on multiple fronts. That included Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) seizing control by eliminating the High Sparrow (Jonathan Pryce) and his zealot followers who humiliated her.  Having painstakingly transformed herself into an assassin, Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) also achieved payback -- in a brilliantly mounted sequence -- for the program's most notorious act of barbarism: the Red Wedding.  Elsewhere, the witch Melisandre (Carice van Houten) was banished for her role in the death of young princess Shireen, one of the fifth season's most stomach-turning interludes.  Finally, the multi-episode dive into \"Thrones\" mythology confirmed what has long been a source of speculation: Jon Snow (Kit Harington) is not the illegitimate child of Eddard Stark, but rather his nephew. That creates plenty of tantalizing possibilities, especially with Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) beginning her massive invasion.  Amid the waves of often-breathless media hype, it's easy to lose sight of what a towering achievement the show represents, not merely in its giant canvas but its stellar talent. This season included the likes of Diana Rigg, Max Von Sydow, Pryce and Ian McShane, beyond the vast roster of regulars.  Related: 'Game of Thrones,' NBA Game 7 to do battle on Sunday night  It's worth noting, too, that the series has deftly moved past George R.R. Martin's books. While that baton pass seemed treacherous, it has enriched the experience in certain ways, while tempering the smugness quotient among those who have read all the novels.  Even with its narrative leaps, it's almost hard to imagine \"Thrones\" completing this sprawling story in the two seasons that remain. After all, the finale offered plenty of foreshadowing regarding \"the great war ... still to come\" with the White Walkers, pitting the living against the armies of the dead.  If this were a play, the curtain calls alone ought to take three episodes, and the producers are talking about wrapping the whole thing up in 13.  Still, at this point it's hard to second-guess producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who, working with Martin, have created a series for the ages. And while it's hard to predict when and how its Winter will end, if what remains rivals what has transpired, calling it \"epic\" won't fully do it justice.

{"text": "Offshore holdings. Shell companies. Secret accounts. These are some of the tools allegedly used by elected leaders, officials and celebrities to hide money, according to reports published by a coalition of news organizations that have opened a window into the shadowy world of offshore investment.  The news reports are based on more than 11 million documents from a single law firm in Panama. The leaked files go back decades and reference 12 current or former world leaders, as well as 128 other politicians and public officials.  Full coverage: Rich and powerful respond to claims they hid billions offshore  Offshore investment is among the murkiest sectors of the financial world. That's by design -- keeping money offshore can help shield money from tax authorities, obscure its origin and conceal the genuine owners.  Why an offshore account?  There are many legitimate reasons for opening an offshore banks account. Wealthy people do it to better manage their investment portfolios or protect their assets. Offshore accounts can also help the rich pay less tax -- legally.  However, offshore accounts are also the lynchpin in many illegal tax avoidance schemes. Owners go to great lengths to conceal the existence of these accounts from their home governments, and they are often helped by lax disclosure rules in offshore tax havens.  Investors caught trying to hide their accounts can face steep penalties.  What's a shell company?  Shell companies look like real companies on paper, but they don't actually do much. They don't make any products, and they typically don't have an office or employees. Shell companies have some legitimate uses in business, but they can also be used to help obscure the ownership of assets or avoid taxes.  It's pretty easy to set one up. For Americans, usually all that's required is a few hours and a couple hundred dollars.  Company officials need to disclose the business to the proper tax authorities, however. Staying on the right side of tax authorities will also require lots of time spent filling out disclosure and tax forms.  Bad actors, meanwhile, can layer shell companies on top of each other, through various jurisdictions, in order to conceal their ownership or launder money.  Where are the top tax havens?   The law firm at the center of the offshore revelations, Mossack Fonseca, is based in Panama. But according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, it has incorporated tens of thousands of companies in Seychelles, an Indian Ocean archipelago often described as a tax haven.  Mossack Fonseca said in a statement that it had done nothing wrong.  \"The facts are these: while we may have been the victim of a data breach, nothing we've seen in this illegally obtained cache of documents suggests we've done anything illegal,\" the firm said.  Tax havens attract investors by having lower tax rates and special exemptions. They also often have lax reporting requirements, making them ideal for questionable activity.  Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands are three of the biggest tax havens for U.S. companies, according to a report last year from the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.  Related: Report IDs world's top tax havens  According to the report, U.S.-controlled companies in these locations reported $155 billion in profits in 2010, the most recent available data. By comparison, the gross domestic product of those countries that year totaled $10 billion.  Bermuda stood out -- booking about $94 billion in profits, dwarfing its gross domestic product of $6 billion.  Tax cheats, beware!  The Panama Papers reports should not be read as a how-to guide. Individuals caught messing around with offshore bank accounts and shell companies in order to avoid taxes or hide dirty money can face massive penalties.  The U.S., for example, is working to implement a new law called the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.  Under FATCA, the U.S. Treasury has struck agreements with more than 100 countries that require those countries' banks to report back to the IRS on any accounts held by U.S. taxpayers.  If the IRS finds that you willfully failed to disclose overseas accounts, you could owe a penalty of 50% of your total balance or $100,000, whichever is greater, for every year you failed to file a special form.  European regulators are also working to crack down on offshore tax evasion.  -- Ivana Kottasova, Alanna Petroff and Jeanne Sahadi contributed reporting.

{"text": "After four long years, Apple unveiled on Thursday a new MacBook Pro. At an event held at its headquarters, the company showed off new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro notebooks. Both include a new display called the Touch Bar at the top of the keyboard.  The display, positioned where the function keys used to be, allows you to control Mac apps with your fingertips. It will adjust in real time based on what software, such as Photoshop, you're using.  The devices feature a trackpad double the size of its previous models. But the 13-inch MacBook Pro is 23% smaller in volume and considerably thinner than the previous version. The smaller version weighs just three pounds -- the 15-inch MacBook Pro clocks in at one pound more.  Touch ID is also coming to the MacBook Pro, located next to the Touch Bar. You can use it for security, like logging into your computer or switching between users, and access Apple Pay with the touch of your finger.  Related: Microsoft goes after Apple users with sleek Surface desktop   With an Intel Core i7 processor and a new graphics card, the 15-inch MacBook Pro is more than twice as fast as the previous 15-inch model. The 13-inch model also features improved speed and performance.  Apple is also making a model of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with traditional function keys and no Touch Bar. The product is meant to appeal to potential 13-inch MacBook Air buyers -- its smaller and thinner (and more affordable) laptop.  The 13-inch MacBook Pro is priced at $1,799, while the 15-inch model is $2,399. The MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar costs $1,499.  The cheapest version will start shipping on Thursday, while the Touch Bar models will be available in a few weeks.  The devices will also work with a new LG 5K display, which launches in December and will cost $1299.  Apple (AAPL, Tech30) CEO Tim Cook kicked off the event by announcing a TV app that lets you access content across other apps. A feature called \"Up Next\" allows you to toggle between what you're watching on your mobile device and the TV (i.e. you'll be able pick up where you left off in a movie bought on iTunes, or a TV show from HBO Now). The free app will roll out by the end of the year.   Cook added that 8,000 apps are now available on Apple TV -- 2,000 of which are games. Popular game Minecraft will be coming to the platform soon.  \"We believe the future of TV is apps,\" Cook said.

Reports published Sunday, based on leaked documents from the firm, allege it helped world leaders, officials and celebrities hide billions of dollars. Mossack Fonseca denies any wrongdoing.  So who is Mossack Fonseca, and why Panama?  Mossack Fonseca was created 30 years ago through a merger between two Panamanian law firms, one headed by Ramon Fonseca, the other by German immigrant Jurgen Mossack.

Related: Rich and powerful respond to claims they hid billions offshore  The company also offers an array of other services, from handling trading permits and customs regulations, wealth management and immigration services, to registering yachts and private jets.

The leaked documents reveal the offshore holdings of individuals and companies from more than 200 countries and territories.  The ICIJ said the firm's controls were inadequate. \"The leaked files show that in some cases Mossack Fonseca's loose procedures allowed blacklisted individuals and other questionable clients to slip by without the firm itself knowing who they were.\"  The firm told the ICIJ it carried out due diligence procedures in accordance with the law.

{"text": "The Chinese market -- half a world away and with a completely different culture -- intimidates many small businesses. And the fears aren't unfounded. It can cost upwards of $100,000 and take more than a year to get products into China.  \"For small businesses, there's a lot of fear of exporting, period,\" said Brad McDearman, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"Only 4% of small firms with employees are actively exporting, and most only to one country.\"  Limited financial resources, fear of products being copied and lack of knowledge about international markets can hold businesses back, said McDearman.  To help ease this transition, Deborah Weidenhamer founded iPai, a Shanghai-based auction company that helps international firms introduce their products to Chinese consumers.  Related: Made in America. Sold in China  Launched in 2012, iPai charges businesses $10,000 to $15,000 (as well as a 35% commission on each sale) and sells their products at live auctions at its Shanghai showroom, at local Chinese malls and online. The company also helps with logistics for subsequent sales: importing, registering trademarks and marketing.  \"Our service lets small businesses test the Chinese market and understand consumer tastes before they make the big investment to enter China,\" said Weidenhamer, who's no stranger to the auction business. She founded Phoenix-based Auction Systems Auctioneers & Appraisers in 1995.  In 2013, iPai organized more than 100 auctions and introduced Chinese consumers to thousands of American products like California craft beer, deep fryers, cigars and nutritional supplements.  Products usually start at $80 but can be auctioned for as much as $23,000, Weidenhamer said. Watches and handbags have been particularly popular.  \"Businesses need to know that if they have a good quality product, Chinese consumers are willing to pay for it,\" said Weidenhamer. \"You could end up selling at a better price and higher quantities than in the U.S.\"  IPai has a sales force that looks for interesting small businesses to take on as clients, she said. It also has a review team that heavily screens the products and rejects those that don't meet their standards.  Because of this, she said products almost always resonate at auction. Less than 10% go unsold, in which case they're featured at another auction or returned to the consignor and iPai doesn't get paid.  Although iPai typically works with companies, it occasionally accepts independent entrepreneurs and inventors who want to discover if a product is right for China, said Weidenhamer.  That's what happened with Sazerac's Fireball Cinnamon Whisky. Produced in Louisiana, the liquor is well-known to U.S. consumers but hasn't had a presence in China.  \"Fireball's logo is a red and gold dragon. It's as if the product is perfect for China,\" said JP Neal, the brand manager for Fireball Whisky's Chinese distributor.   The challenge, however, was that cinnamon isn't a widely-used flavor in Chinese cuisine. So Neal, a consultant looking to bring popular American products into China, wanted to better understand how Chinese consumers would react to the liquor.  Neal independently hired iPai for $10,000 to help him test the market. Last fall, iPai auctioned off a case of the whisky. Some of the bottles sold for as high as $300 (in the States, a bottle goes for around $30). Neal also used the auction to poll attendees about the brand's packaging, taste and how they would drink it.  \"I got exactly the type of feedback I wanted,\" said Neal. He then approached Sazerac and convinced the company to introduce the brand to China (which landed him his current job).  Neal said a container of 420 cases of Fireball (over 5,000 bottles) is set to arrive in China in April, and it's already presold. A second container of 900 cases will ship in June.

The government hopes to boost this by 50,000 by 2017.  Weidenhamer is poised to take advantage of that growth.  Currently, just 5% of iPai's clients are U.S.-based, but she significantly increase that number. And as business ramps up, she also hopes to expands iPai's services to other Chinese cities.  Brookings' McDearman said iPai's efforts could be promising.   \"We are starting to see more private-sector initiatives like this come up to spur exports,\" he said. \"It's happening because there aren't enough public-sector services available to provide resources and assistance here or on the ground in China.\" ", "date": "NA", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/03/smallbusiness/china-ipai/index.html", "author": "Parija Kavilanz"}[

{"text": "Donald Trump's economic plans are suddenly getting gold stars on Wall Street. Big banks such as Bank of America (BAC), UBS (UBS) and HSBC (HSBC) are bumping up their predictions for U.S. growth and stock market gains. The reason? Trumponomics.  \"Following Donald Trump's election victory, we have altered our GDP forecasts as we are now expecting a modest fiscal stimulus from lower tax rates and higher government spending,\" wrote HSBC chief U.S. economist Kevin Logan in a recent report.  It's a stunning reversal from the days before the election when economists and market experts at many Wall Street banks were forecasting dire consequences -- a recession and a swift market drop -- if Trump were elected president.  Now many are saying the opposite: Trump is good for growth.  \"Well-executed U.S. fiscal policy could boost growth substantially,\" says Don Rissmiller of investment firm Strategas. Rissmiller predicts GDP growth could be a full 1% higher in 2017 and 2018.  The U.S. has been expanding at a pace of about 2% a year. Trump vows to get America to 4%.  Related: Saudis believe Trump will unleash America's economy  The Trump market rally  The stock market has surged to record levels after Trump's election. Investors cheered his promises of massive tax cuts for individuals and businesses, a rollback on onerous regulations and up to $1 trillion of new government spending on roads, bridges and other infrastructure.  The Dow is up over 5% this month, and comes after three months of losses.  \"The market has sailed through some of this year's biggest shocks (U.K. Referendum, U.S. election),\" wrote the Bank of America Merrill Lynch team in a recent report. The team raised its forecast for the S&P 500 index to end the year at 2,100, up from 2,000.  On top of the tax cuts, investors also like the idea of giving big businesses like Apple (AAPL, Tech30) a tax discount to bring the cash they have stashed overseas back to the United States.

Wells Fargo (WFC) put it this way: \"Tax cuts and additional federal spending could stimulate economic growth, but tariffs and restricting immigration may slow the economy. These policy prospects create potentially offsetting effects.\" Due to the trade concerns, Wells Fargo hasn't hiked its GDP forecast. However it does expect higher inflation.  Mitt Romney -- now under consideration to be Trump's Secretary of State pick -- was one of many business leaders who slammed Trump for his plans to place hefty taxes on Mexican and Chinese goods coming into the U.S. Romney even said Trump's trade ideas would send the nation careening into a recession.  Trump's plan for his first 100 days in office includes \"renegotiating\" or \"withdrawing\" from NAFTA and labeling China a \"currency manipulator.\" It's unclear how far he will go.

{"text": "In the three weeks since Election Day, the news media has fallen into a familiar routine. Donald Trump fires off a tweet and reporters scramble to file stories about it. The pattern has caused some to wonder if the tweets are a deliberate distraction by Trump.  But it appears that, at times, Trump may be behaving like so many other Twitter users and simply responding emotionally to what he's watching on television. In at least six instances since Election Day, the subject of Trump's tweets has pertained to a segment that had just aired on TV.  On Tuesday morning, seemingly out of nowhere, Trump took to Twitter to express his staunch opposition to burning the American flag. Incineration of Old Glory, Trump tweeted shortly before 7 a.m. ET, should be met with either \"loss of citizenship or year in jail!\"   Flag burning hasn't drawn much recent attention in American politics. But it was brought up on Fox News on Tuesday morning.  Roughly 30 minutes before Trump's tweet, the channel's morning show, \"Fox & Friends\" -- on which Trump had long been a regular guest -- ran a segment about a protest at a Massachusetts college over the school's decision to stop flying all flags after students allegedly burned an American flag to protest Trump's victory. (A reporter for ABC News first noted the timing of the segment.)  It's possible Trump was motivated to take a stand on flag burning for other reasons; his spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond to a request for comment  But it wouldn't have been the first time that Trump, an avid cable news consumer, reacted in real-time to something he watched on Fox News, MSNBC or CNN.  On Monday night at 9:05 p.m. ET, CNN aired a report by correspondent Jeff Zeleny refuting Trump's baseless claim that there were \"millions\" of illegal votes cast in the election. By 9:14 p.m. ET, Trump was retweeting supporters who had maligned Zeleny and CNN.  On the morning of November 13, Trump claimed in a tweet that the New York Times \"is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'Trump phenomena.'\"   A half hour before Trump sent that tweet, \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" ran a segment regarding an email that Times' publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and executive editor Dean Baquet sent to subscribers in which they reflected on the newspaper's coverage of Trump. Nowhere in the email did Sulzberger and Baquet mention losing subscribers -- and the Times has since touted a significant increase in subscribers -- but the segment included a suggestion that the paper is taking a hit.  \"You know what they suffer from? Their bottom line. Their business they got to make money, and they're not making it. They've been hearing from their readers,\" Fox News contributor Pete Hegseth said.   Two days later, a week after his win in the Electoral College, Trump tweeted that he would would have \"easily\" triumphed if the election were decided by popular vote. \"Fox & Friends\" had held a panel discussion about anti-Trump protests that touched on Hillary Clinton's edge in the popular vote an hour before.  This past Saturday night, Trump was irked again by questions surrounding the vote tally, tweeting that the recount effort led by Green Party nominee Jill Stein was a \"scam\" that \"is now being joined by the badly defeated & demoralized Dems.\"  Minutes before that tweet, Fox News had reported on-air on the Clinton campaign joining the recount in three states.  Related: News media struggles to cover Trump's tweets and falsehoods  The journalism world is still figuring out how to cover the new president-elect, who feuds and tweets far more than most other elected officials -- much less occupants of the White House. As editors contemplate whether his tweets are worth reporting, Trump is already challenging the idea that everything a president does is newsworthy and deserving of coverage.  Not all of Trump's tweets are quite so confrontational or controversial. He has also used the platform to extend the occasional conciliatory gesture, as he did on the morning on November 20, when he tweeted kind words about the newly elected Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer. The tweet went out to Trump's millions of followers as a pre-taped interview with Schumer aired on NBC's \"Meet The Press.\"  Moments after the interview ended, \"Meet the Press\" co-host Chuck Todd was reading Trump's tweet on air.

{"text": "A handwritten manuscript by mathematician Alan Turing, subject of the Oscar-winning movie, \"The Imitation Game,\" has sold for $1,025,000 at auction. Turing apparently wrote the 56-page manuscript in 1942 when he was trying to create one of the world's first computers in order to break the German military's code, known as Enigma. Those efforts, which were successful and were credited with being a key to the Allied victory in World War II, are the focus of much of the movie. It received eight Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Actor for Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays Turing, and won the award for best adapted screenplay.  The winning bid on Monday was near the low end of the expected sales price announced by Bonhams, which handled the New York auction.  \"This is a wonderful result and a fitting testament to Alan Turing's impact and legacy,\" said Cassandra Hatton, an executive at Bonhams.  The book was originally left to a close friend of Turing, fellow mathematician Robin Gandy. Gandy also wrote his own notes in the blank spaces of the manuscript. Gandy died in 1995, and the owner of the manuscript who put it up for auction was not disclosed by the auction house, nor was the buyer. An undisclosed amount of the proceeds of Monday's auction are being donated to charity.  Related: First U.S. penny sold for $1.2 million  There was a time that computers were known as Turing machines. But Turing's life story became tragic when he faced criminal charges in England for being a homosexual, which was illegal at the time. He was given the choice between chemical castration to \"cure\" his homosexuality or imprisonment. He chose the former so that he could continue his work creating early computers.   He committed suicide in 1954, although there are conspiracy theories that he was murdered. He received a posthumous apology from British Prime Minister Gordon Brown for his \"appalling\" treatment in 2009 and a royal pardon five years later.

{"text": "Donald Trump, candidate, mogul and author of classics such as Think Big and Kick Ass, has pulled back the financial curtain on his vast, often eponymous holdings. But his 92-page disclosure forms released Wednesday don't actually clear up the confusion about his true wealth.  It's a touchy subject that dates back at least to 2006, when Trump sued Tim O'Brien, author of TrumpNation, because O'Brien reported a much lower net worth figure for Trump than Trump himself asserted. Like, a tenth less.  The suit was eventually dismissed. But O'Brien noted in a Bloomberg column that when his lawyers asked Trump how he figured his net worth, Trump said it \"goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings.\"  Fast forward to 2015, and The Donald has been asserting his net worth is $10 billion. Forbes and Wealth-X have put it at closer to $4 billion.  The official disclosure forms just released don't require exact values placed on assets and liabilities but rather ranges. The top range that one can report is \"over $50 million.\"  Based on CNN's analysis of Trump's disclosure forms, he reported at least $1.4 billion in assets and $265 million in liabilities.  Let others quibble about his net worth. Is he or isn't he worth $10 billion? Anything over $100 million and let's just agree he's rich.  But we found it interesting that:  Trump's book royalties alone trump most Americans' annual household income: He lists 15 books on his official financial disclosure forms. But only four generate any income. Combined, Think Like A Champion, The Art of the Deal, Time to Get Tough and The Midas Touch brought in between $85,000 and $215,000.  Turns out talk isn't cheap: Trump has pulled in $1.75 million in speaking fees between May 2014 and March 2015.  The man really, really likes his name on the door: Of the 515 entities for which Trump lists himself as chairman, president, vice president, director, partner, member, secretary or treasurer, 276 (54%) of them have \"Trump\" in the name.  Related from CNN: This is how rich Trump is  Another 63 entities are listed by acronyms beginning with a \"T\" which often stands for Trump -- e.g. THC (Trump Hotel Collection).  Trump gets a pension: That's a relief. Real estate, after all, is a risky business. But thanks to the Screen Actors Guild, Trump will be entitled to $110,228 in pension income. It's not clear from the form whether that's a total payout to date or an annual event. The value of the pension as an asset is listed as \"not readily ascertainable.\"  His \"Apprentice\" salary fell a little shy of his campaign's claim: According to Trump's financial disclosure forms, he earned $14,222 from his NBC show, \"The Apprentice,\" although over what period is unclear. But his production company, \"Trump Productions,\" earned production revenue of over $4 million. In any case, it comes in well below the average $15.2 million his campaign suggested he earned per season over the past 14 seasons.  His wife can tide him over for a week if need be: Trump's wife, Melania, has her own skin care line that brought in royalty income between $100,001 and $1 million.  He put money on the ponies and won big: Trump owns Trump Carousel LLC, which operates the storied Central Park Carousel. One go-round costs $3 per person (cash only, please). From that he reported nearly $600,000 in income. More lucrative for him is the nearby Wollman Rink, which his Wollman Rink LLC operates. It generated close to $8.7 million in income likely thanks in part to admission fees of $11.25 for adults and $6.00 for kids during the week, more on weekends. Spectators must cough up $5.

{"text": "With the price of oil tanking and the ruble getting pummeled, high-end real estate brokers in Manhattan, Miami and other major cities have been losing some of their best customers. Deep-pocketed Russian buyers have been disappearing since last spring when international sanctions were imposed on Russia.  Over the past few years, Russian buyers have been responsible for some of the flashiest purchases in New York, according to Gabby Warshawer, research director for CityRealty, a website specializing in New York City sales.  Among them: the record breaking $88 million purchase of a Central Park West condo by Ekaterina Rybolovlev, the daughter of billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev; composer, Igor Krutoy's $48 million purchase of a duplex in the Plaza Hotel and the $38 million purchase of an apartment in Time Warner Center by businessman, Andrei Vavilov.  \"This year, we haven't seen any of those chart-topping sales,\" said Warshawer.  Related: New York's most expensive rental costs $500,000 a month  Russian buyers were driving the ultra-high-end market in Florida as well, according to Danny Hertzberg, a Coldwell Banker agent with The Jills Group in Miami Beach.  The most expensive sale in Miami's history was a home that sold for $47 million in 2012 to an unidentified Russian buyer. But even that paled in comparison to the $95 million sale of Donald Trump's Palm Beach palace in 2010 to Dmitry Rybolovlev, the father of Ekaterina, the woman who bought that $88 million condo on Central Park West.  Last spring, however, all of those deep-pocketed Russians seemed to disappear, said Hertzberg.  \"It felt like it changed almost overnight,\" he said.  Related: 10 least affordable rental markets  The big drop off occurred right after the Russian government tightened its currency restrictions, making it difficult for Russian nationals to move large sums of money out of the country. It's now even getting to be a challenge for some to transfer the small amounts of cash they need to pay real estate taxes and maintenance costs, Hertzberg said.  It's difficult to know just how much of an impact the pullout of Russian buyers will have on markets like New York, said Warshawer. Not only do fair housing laws make it almost impossible to accurately track a buyer's nationality, but the buyer's identity may also be concealed since many of the most expensive properties get bought and sold through middle men and limited liability companies.  However, New York appraiser Jonathan Miller, of Miller Samuel, isn't too concerned.  Related: New York's multi-million dollar condo sales keep soaring  \"I kept hearing about Russians dominating New York's high-end market but they never really did,\" he said. \"They just had the highest profiles.\"  But Hertzberg notes, the Russian buyers play another role, too. Like many other foreign clients, they were much more bullish on the U.S. real estate market during the housing bust than Americans were.  \"Russians were willing to go well beyond what others would pay for trophy properties,\" said Hertzberg.  He thinks the rich Russian buyers will come back quickly if they can find a way to extract their wealth from the mother country.  \"I hear from some Russian clients that the decline of the ruble has made them even more eager to buy here,\" he said.

{"text": "The virtues of giving were instilled in Arthur Stainman from an early age. \"When I was growing up, my parents didn't have a lot of money, but they always shared what little they had with others that were less fortunate,\" said the New York-based money manager.  Now, as a successful professional, he's carrying on that legacy, but he's doing it in a way with serious financial benefits.  He's one of many people taking advantage of a provision in the tax code that lets benefactors donate appreciated stock to charity.  It's a win-win situation: charitable organizations get a nice contribution (they usually sell shares immediately), while donors can write off the gift and avoid paying capital gains taxes on the stock gains.  Related: The 2014 tax breaks you'll be able to take  The strategy has been around for some time, but after waning during the financial crisis, it's gained popularity again in recent years as the stock market has roared back to life.  Easy to-do: Stainman's charity of choice is the Food Bank For New York City, where he has served on the board since 2007. As a member of the so-called \"1%,\" he noted that his high tax rate makes stock donations even more attractive.  \"For a donor it makes the most sense,\" he said. \"It's an easy, seamless transaction.\"  Most of the stocks Stainman donates are ones that he's owned for quite some time and would be looking to offload anyway.  \"I've really been able to rebalance my portfolio in a way that's very tax efficient,\" he said.  Related: 2014: Helluva good year for stocks  Warren Buffett is another devotee of donating stocks to charities. His $2 billion gift to the Gates Foundation came in the form of shares of his Berkshire Hathaway company.  The practice usually enables donors to give more money to the charity than they would if they sold the stocks on their own, paid taxes on the gains, and then donated the cash to the organization.  Charities love it: For non-profits, stock donations are a major boon to their coffers. They've even beefed up their promotional materials to educate people about the tactic.  Alyssa Herman, Chief Development Officer for the Food Bank For New York City, said that although stock gifts only make up about 1.25% of total donations, many times they tend to be major gifts worth over $10,000.  \"When people really love an organization, this can help them give something a little bigger than they might have,\" she alleged.  Indeed, the rising stock market doesn't hurt either. The Food Bank experienced close to a 50% jump in stock donations in its latest fiscal year.  Not just for the rich: While stock donations are traditionally utilized by the wealthy, anyone who itemizes their deductions can take advantage, according to Deborah Lauer, who works in the Estate Planning Group at Wells Fargo Advisors.  And until the end of this year, those who are 70.5 years of age and older can make a charitable cash distribution of up $100,000 directly from their IRA. (Congress has been renewing this rule for the last few years, but has never made it law). However, since the distribution is not taxable, it's also not tax deductible, Lauer pointed out.  More typically, she explained, clients will make stock donations from a non-retirement account so they get the tax benefit.  \"We're really looking at individuals who see something in society they want to improve, and if they can get a tax deduction from it, obviously that's an additional benefit,\" she said.

The median household net worth of middle-income Americans remained at $96,500 between 2010 and 2013, according to a new report from the Pew Research Center, which looked at Federal Reserve Bank data.  Upper-income households, however, saw their wealth grow to $639,400 last year, up from $595,300.  Related: Elizabeth Warren: 'Wealth trickles up'  That means the rich have 6.6 times more wealth than the middle class, a figure that's grown from 4.1 in 1998 and 3.4 in 1983.  It's also a record 69 times the wealth of lower-income Americans, who had accumulated only $9,300 as of last year.  Related: Whites get wealthier, while Blacks and Hispanics lag further behind   Part of the reason for the gap stems from how the rich and the middle class build wealth. The former are more likely to invest in the stock market, which has been on a tear in recent years. The latter have more of their net worth tied up in the housing market, which hasn't recovered as much.  That's also why the Great Recession had a bigger impact on the net worth of the middle class. Back in 2007, before the housing crash, the middle class saw its median wealth soar to $158,400.  The rich also haven't recovered fully from the downturn, but they are a lot closer to their 2007 peak of $718,000.  Looking longer term, the rich have more than doubled the size of their nest eggs over the past three decades, while the middle class have inched up 2.3%.  Pew defines middle income as family of four with a household income between $44,000 and $132,000. Some 46% of American household fall into middle income under its methodology, which adjusts for family size. Upper-income Americans are those who earn more than $132,000 for a family of four.

That's right: affluent Americans aren't all reading AARP magazine at a tony golf resort. Some probably read Buzzfeed too.  Call it the Mark Zuckerberg trend. In the 1960s, almost half of the wealthiest Americans were senior citizens. Now less than 40% of the super rich are over 65, according to a recent report by economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.  This shift is happening as wealth inequality in America reaches its highest levels since the 1920s.  Unsurprisingly, the rich are getting richer thanks primarily to ownership in stocks and bonds.  Related: Amercia's youngest female billionaire  Rising inequality: Inequality peaked during the Roaring Twenties, then fell after the Great Depression, hitting its lowest point in the 1970s.

The gap between most Americans and the upper echelon continues to grow quickly.  Between 1986 and 2012, the top 0.1% of Americans took in half of the nation's wealth accumulation while wealth growth stayed flat for most Americans.  The trend is unlikely to change soon.

{"text": "Donald Trump, who famously called himself the \"king of debt,\" may have ironically brought about the end of Wall Street's golden age in debt. Societe Generale warned investors this week that the decade-long party in the debt markets \"is over.\" Borrowing costs are poised to rise rapidly, hurting the economy and fueling a stampede out of debt funds more powerful than what markets expect.  \"Prepare for a serious hangover,\" SocGen wrote in a report on Monday.  An \"unprecedented build-up of debt\" over the past decade will likely worsen the pain and make any bond selloff \"more dangerous,\" the firm said.  Already, there are signs that the music has stopped in this popular corner of the markets.  Trump's election and plans to stimulate the American economy by borrowing money has fueled a massive bet on stronger growth and more inflation. When that happens, investors tend to dump boring bonds in favor of risky stocks.  While stocks have soared to record highs, behind the scenes there's been a \"violent\" wave of selling in the bond markets, bumping up borrowing costs. The 10-year Treasury yield has skyrocketed to 2.34%, compared with 1.85% on Election Day. It's increased the price of other forms of credit, including mortgages.  Related: 2 powerful market forces could hurt Trump's plans  Bank of America Merrill Lynch called it a \"stampede\" out of bond funds. Investors yanked $18 billion out of bond funds in the week after the election, the most dramatic outflow in 3.5 years.  Trump's \"unanticipated rise\" has let some of the air out of the \"bond market bubble,\" S&P Global wrote in a report on Tuesday.  Some believe the post-election rush out of bonds and into stocks may be overdone and due for a reversal. That may be true. After all, the end of the bond bubble has been wrongly called many times in recent years.  But here's why SocGen thinks this is just the beginning of a larger \"unwinding.\"  Growth pick-up: Even before Trump's election, the economy appears to have gathered momentum. The U.S. economy grew at a healthy 3.2% in the third quarter, the best pace in two years. Wall Street thinks the economy could grow even faster given Trump's promises to provide stimulus by cutting taxes and ramping up infrastructure.  Central banks take a back seat: Fiscal stimulus may allow the Federal Reserve and other central banks to ease off the emergency steps that had been keeping rates super low. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates in December for the second time since 2007. However, expectations are that the momentum on rate increases will only pick up next year.  Inflation showing signs of life: SocGen said inflation is \"bottoming out,\" a trend that should hurt demand for debt and allow central banks to further raise interest rates. For instance, U.S. wages grew in October by the fastest since June 2009.   Adding to American debt: Trump's planned tax cuts and infrastructure spending may \"substantially raise the deficit,\" SocGen said. Trump's fiscal proposals will cause the U.S. debt to soar to 105% of GDP by 2026, compared with nearly 77% today, according to estimates from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.   Sign up for CNNMoney's morning market newsletter: Before The Bell  If the debt party is truly over, the consequences could be massive for global financial markets.  Obviously, this would be bad news for bond funds, which have become very popular during the recent boom. Keep in mind that the market value of investment grade bonds tracked by Barclays Global Aggregate Fund has doubled over the past decade to a stunning $45 trillion, according to SocGen.  Performance in large bond funds is already \"fast deteriorating\" and losses and withdrawals will only continue if rates keep rising, SocGen predicted.  But bond investors are no different than the people who invest in the stock market. That means the pain in bonds could force selling that spills over into the broader markets.  Even after the recent turmoil, rates remain very low. But if they continue to rise, that could hurt the economy by translating to higher borrowing costs. Already, mortgage rates have risen significantly, making it more expensive to buy a home. This powerful force could make Trump's plans for an economic boom more difficult to achieve.   Likewise, higher rates translates to elusive credit for companies without the perfect balance sheets of Apple (AAPL, Tech30). Recall that the shale oil revolution that has transformed the global energy landscape was partially fueled by easy credit.  Another potential consequence: trouble for emerging markets. That's because the recent debt turmoil has coincided with a stronger U.S. dollar, which makes it harder for overseas borrowers to pay back dollar-denominated debt. SocGen estimates that dollar-denominated credit overseas has doubled to nearly $10 trillion over the past decade, especially in emerging markets.

The 50 most generous donors in the U.S. gave away $9.8 billion in 2014, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy. That figure was up 28% from the year before, driven largely by a rise in the number of tech entrepreneurs donating millions of dollars, as well as a huge donation ($1.5 billion) from Bill and Melinda Gates.  The top 50 givers run the gamut, proving that there's definitely more than one way to make money. And their donations can reveal little-known facts about the lives of the ultra-wealthy.  There are a lot of big names on this year's list, but here's just a taste of some of the donors, how they got rich, and where they're giving (in no particular order).  You can get really rich running truck stops. The Haslam family has operated a chain of truck stops throughout the U.S. since the 1950s and they also bought the Cleveland Browns football team in 2012. Last year it donated $50 million to the University of Tennessee at Knoxville's business school.  Napster's Sean Parker has life-threatening allergies. He's allergic to peanuts, tree nuts and shellfish, so he donated $24 million in December to start an allergy research center at Stanford University.  Related: 95-year-old billionaire and 39-year-old Go Pro founder among top givers of 2014  You can also get really rich selling collectables and sports memorabilia.  Ted Stanley's company, MBI, got its start selling a series of medals commemorating the 1969 moon landing. The 83-year-old is giving $650 million to scientists at MIT and Harvard to research the genetics behind disorders like autism.  Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen made the largest private donation ever to the Ebola fight.  The Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) co-founder pledged $100 million to groups like the American Red Cross, the Centers for Disease Control, and Unicef to fight the disease.

One big success that he did have: Wilson gave away more money than anyone in the U.S. last year after Bill Gates, donating about $1 billion to several different charities.  Young tech guys are super generous. Three tech entrepreneurs under the age of 40 landed donated more than $500 million each: WhatsApp's Jan Koum, Sean Parker, and GoPro (GPRO) founder Nicholas Woodman.

The good news is it should be easy to spot thanks to its distinctive flower-patterned vinyl top. The \"Mod Top\" option was offered by Chrysler (FCAU), which made Plymouth cars, for a short time in a bid to win more female customers. Only one buyer ever chose to get that flowery feature on a Plymouth muscle car that had the 425-horsepower Hemi engine option.  A 1970 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda, with or without the flowered roof, is an extremely rare and valuable car.  \"This is a work of art,\" said Joe Stephenson, managing director for special investigations at Hagerty Insurance, the company that insures the Plymouth. \"It's just like a Picasso or any other valuable work of art.\"  Steven Juliano of Pelham Manor, New York was the Hemi 'Cuda's most recent owner, at least until someone stole the car from him around midnight on Monday, April 25.  \"We're trying to determine if this was a targeted theft or if it was a crime of opportunity,\" said Stephenson.  The car was stolen as it was being prepared to be shipped to another location, he said. It's not clear if the thief knew the value of this particular car or was simply very lucky.  Given the publicity surrounding the theft of this particular 'Cuda, it will be extremely hard for whoever has it to sell it, or even to show it off without authorities being alerted, said Stephenson. Even if the flowered top is peeled off, it would still be fairly easy to identify the car.  Related - Criminal's muscle car collection auctioned for $2.5 million  \"They're going to try to sell it, eventually, to an honest buyer,\" Stephenson said.  Juliano declined to speak to CNNMoney when reached through his insurance company.  The flowered, vinyl top is actually the only part of the car that is not original, Stephenson said. The patterned vinyl is a reproduction of the covering that was on the car when it was new.  Hagerty Insurance is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to the safe return of the muscle car.

Gordon Ramsay knows what travelers say about airport food. It's \"flavorless crap.\"  But the renowned chef is changing that with his \"Plane Food\" restaurant at Heathrow.  \"Airline or airport food has always been something people loved to dismiss as disappointing, flavorless crap -- and they weren't necessarily wrong,\" the TV series \"Masterchef\" judge told CNNMoney. \"I wanted to bring my passion for food into that space and build a quality establishment that caters to the traveler.\"   Plane Food, of course, doesn't serve typical plane food.  With 14 Michelin stars securely tucked under his apron, the Scottish-born Ramsay draws inspiration from years spent in Michelin-starred kitchens and his global network of high-end restaurants.  Diners could start with burrata and black truffle served on toasted focaccia or salt and Szechuan pepper baby squid, before moving on to in-house specials -- the Plane Food short rib burger or some saffron butter chicken curry with cumin rice. Don't forget dessert. Indulge in a local favorite -- Banana sticky toffee pudding -- or perhaps coconut sorbet.  Fine food delivered with speed: Ramsay's secret ingredient is time.  \"Our goal was to be able to serve multiple course meals within 25 minutes, as well as sell takeaway cool boxes which are designed to be taken on flights,\" he said. \"We've designed Plane Food with that in mind, so whether you're a businessman or woman rushing to catch a connecting flight or a family of four who has some down time before taking off, we've got it covered.\"   The restaurant, however, has received lukewarm responses from Tripadvisor, Yelp and Opentable, receiving an average of 3.5 stars out of 5. British restaurant journalist and critic Jan Moir once commented that Plane Food's food \"is simply not good enough to tempt first class and business class passengers out of their exclusive lounges.\"  Besides his airport gastronomic joint, Ramsay operates 27 restaurants bearing his name that stretch across Europe, the US and Asia. His signature restaurant, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in London, has been consistently awarded three Michelin stars since 2001.  He is also the face of TV series and cooking shows, with programs on both sides of the Atlantic.  Ramsay's famous Hell's Kitchen cooking competition series first aired in the UK in summer 2004 before making its debut in America the following year.

{"text": "The Falcon Wing doors are without a doubt the coolest-looking part of Tesla's new Model X crossover SUV. And they're actually even cooler than they look. These doors sense and react to their surroundings. The Falcon Wing doors are hinged at the top, like the more familiar gullwing doors found on those classic Mercedes-Benz sports cars. But each of the Tesla (TSLA) doors has a second hinge that creates something like an elbow. That allows the doors to open in different ways depending on the situation.  The simplest and fastest way for these doors to open is up and out, like the Mercedes doors do.  But Tesla's elbow means that Model X drivers can park anywhere -- even in tight spaces.  Related: Tesla's new Model X will cost you  The Falcon Wing doors are equipped with sensors that can tell if there is something next to or above them. So if if there's a car parked right next to the Model X the top part of the door will swing up but, at the same time, the elbow will bend in. That way the bottom part of the door that runs parallel to the side of the car will be pulled almost straight up without hitting anything.  If the car is parked somewhere with a low ceiling, say a garage, the doors will go up as far as they can, then the elbows will bend out to make enough room for people to get in or out.  Tesla's ultrasonic sensors bounce high-pitched sound waves (that can't be detected by the human ear) off of objects around the vehicle to detect anything that might get in the way.  The designers wanted to preserve the smooth skin of the SUV, so the company figured out a way to do all of this without having any sensors visible on the outside of the car.  Tesla engineers invented sensors that could \"see\" through aluminum sheet metal, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said, so that they can be hidden inside the doors. Musk admitted that the Model X's incredible complexity had been a challenge in getting it ready for production.  Photos - Bentley's new SUV: Bentayga  And sensors can also see inside the door, not just outside of it. So if a Falcon Wing door is closing and there's an arm or a leg in the way it will stop moving.  Tesla engineers didn't just study science to make all this work, though. Musk said he wanted the doors' movements as graceful as possible  \"Actually, I had the engineers watch ballet,\" he said.  Hopefully, the dance will impress the 25,000 buyers who ordered a Model X before even seeing it.

Every gentleman should, says Vincent Nasserbakht, co-owner of The Sock Hop, a men's specialty store in New York City.  \"A sock will show how much a man has put into his wardrobe -- if he's just using it as an afterthought or if he's really tying his outfit together,\" says Nasserbakht. \"If you're wearing really nice shoes, you should be wearing really nice socks.\"  So forget the 5 pack of black socks -- or worse yet, going sock-less, says Nasserbakht.  Every man should have 3 types of socks in his wardrobe, he says.  First is the basic sock.  \"It can be a pretty black or a navy but it should also follow some rules,\" says Nasserbakht. \"You shouldn't show your leg between your pant and your socks, so it should provide enough coverage.\"  Wear these at important meetings and conservative workplaces, Nasserbakht advises.  Second is the colorful sock.  These socks let you show off your personality and are great for work parties. Just make sure the color fits with the rest of what your wearing.   You can \"wear really bright and colorful socks without clashing,\" Nasserbakht says.

These are best for tech company employees and weekend wear. \"Don't wear this sock to court, a funeral, or anywhere you're going to embarrass somebody,\" he says.

{"text": "Donald Trump's tax proposals could spur more economic growth and more jobs ... for awhile. But by 2024, that positive effect turns negative. His plan would slow growth created relative to what's expected under today's policies.  Hillary Clinton's plan would do the opposite -- having a somewhat negative effect on growth in the first several years, and a more positive one after that.  That's according to a new macroeconomic analysis by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School in collaboration with the Tax Policy Center.  \"In the short run, Trump's tax plan reduces taxes on business and higher income Americans, boosting investment and work, which results in more economic growth. However, in the long run, the Trump tax plan increases federal debt more than current policy, resulting in less economic growth,\" Penn Wharton noted in its report.  Here's why: Even accounting for the positive macroeconomic effects, the Trump tax cuts are estimated to reduce revenue by $7 trillion in the first decade alone. Absent offsetting measures, that means the United States would have to borrow a lot more money than it already does. That, in turn, means the U.S. government will be competing with the private sector to attract investors' dollars, and that will drive money away from a productive part of the economy.  Related: What Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton want to do to your tax bill  \"If the tax cut substantially increases government debt ... the debt competes with private capital for household savings and international capital flows,\" the Penn Wharton report said.  Its model estimates that Trump's plan could add an additional 1.1% in 2018 relative to current law. But by 2024 that positive effect is erased and by 2027 it could lower GDP by 0.78%. By 2037, it could produce 4.6% less GDP than expected.  There are ways that the long-run effects of the revenue loss created by Trump's plan would not be negative. But the changes needed to offset them might not be realistic.  For instance, Trump and his economic advisers have asserted that revenue losses under his tax plan could be offset in part through spending cuts. But he's ruled out touching Medicare and Social Security. To fully offset the negative effects of the debt created by his tax plan, Trump would have to cut non-Medicare, non-Social Security spending by 50%, said Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model.  Or, Smetters noted, the amount of foreign investment in new U.S. debt would have to reach levels far above the historical average of 40%.  Trump camp rejects the analysis  The so-called \"dynamic scoring\" model used by Penn Wharton doesn't account for Trump's other economic proposals -- such as for trade, energy and regulation. Nor does it account for the economic effects of his spending plans, such as his proposal to boost infrastructure spending.  That's one reason why Trump's economic advisers essentially reject the findings.  \"It only looks at taxes. It tortures its result [by extending the window over 25 years]. It makes a wrong assumption about how debt affects [interest] rates. And it ignores the role of growth in the process,\" said Trump adviser Peter Navarro, an economist at the University of California-Irvine.  The Trump camp wants outside experts to score Trump's economic plan as a whole. They believe his trade and energy policies will spur enough growth to offset any revenue loss in his tax plan. Outside experts are dubious, but haven't been able to model his spending and other plans together both because of a lack of policy specifics and a lack of adequate modeling tools to do so, they say.  What about Clinton's plan?  The analysis found that the effects of Clinton's tax plan would essentially be the reverse of Trump's.  Clinton's tax plan would raise taxes largely on high-income households but also businesses. As a result, \"in the short run, [her plan] dampens investment and work, which results in less economic growth. However, in the long run, the Clinton tax plan reduces federal debt relative to current policy resulting in more economic growth,\" the Penn Wharton report noted.  Overall her tax plan raises more than $1 trillion -- all of it earmarked for her spending proposals -- so it's not expected to add to the debt in the long run  Her plan would produce 0.3% less GDP than currently projected for 2018 but that negative effect starts to turn positive by 2028, according to the UPenn/Wharton model. And by 2037, it would produce 0.7% more GDP than would be the case under today's policies.  Like the Trump camp, the Clinton campaign would have preferred an analysis of the economic effects of all her plans taken together.  \"[B]ecause this analysis only takes into account the candidates' tax plans, it doesn't show the truly stark differences between their economic visions],\" said senior policy advisor Jacob Leibenluft. \"As other analyses have shown, Secretary Clinton's investments in areas like infrastructure, innovation and education will create good-paying jobs, whereas Donald Trump's harmful proposals on immigration and trade will result in a recession.\"  Correction: The original version of this article incorrectly stated that Clinton's plan is estimated to generate 4% more GDP in 2037.

{"text": "Donald Trump announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday, and in his speech he harped on one of his best qualities: His money. Most presidential candidates try to identify with the everyman voter -- Hillary Clinton kicked off her campaign by saying \"democracy can't be just for billionaires and corporations.\" But Trump has always broadcast his wealth.  \"I'm really rich,\" he said.  Just how rich has been a matter of debate for years.  Trump said at the campaign kickoff that he's now worth more than $8.7 billion. Standing at the podium as he addressed the crowd, he waved around a one-page summary of his assets and liabilities.  The document lists $302 million in liquid assets. Beyond that, the assets he lists are hard for the public to quantify, including $3.3 billion in real estate licensing and branding deals. In addition, he lists $3.7 billion in commercial real estate.  Related: Hillary Clinton unleashes attack on Wall Street  Trump promised to issue a complete financial disclosure, including income tax returns, sometime before the first Republican debate takes place.  But third parties that are in the business of assessing the wealth of others have said the real estate magnate is worth much less.  Forbes puts the figure at $4.1 billion. Wealth-X says it's closer to $4.2 billion, though Fauzi Ahmad, a spokesperson for the wealth assessment firm, said the intangible value of the \"Trump brand\" may boost that number.  The value of any brand is difficult to quantify, and Trump's is no different. That's where there tend to be the biggest discrepancies between him and third parties. For instance, while Trump values his brand at more than $3 billion, Forbes puts it at just $125 million.  Regardless of the specifics, Trump said his deep pockets are what make him the best person to take over as America's head of state.  \"It's not bragging. That's the kind of mindset you need for this country,\" Trump said. He added that his financial security means he won't be swayed by lobbyists or donors with special interests.  Not everyone is convinced that Trump is that rich, but the Celebrity Apprentice star has staunchly defended his wealth over the years.  Related: NBC to 're-evaluate Trump's 'Apprentice' role  When Timothy O'Brien claimed Trump was only worth between $150 and $250 million in his 2005 book, \"TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald,\" Trump sued the author in a $5 billion defamation suit and lost.

It's really good to use that time for contemplation.\"  One thing McKelvey hasn't quite figured out is what to do post-security, pre-boarding.  \"That's the worst. I usually sit there feeling anxious and annoyed.

{"text": "They're so rich, they make the 1% look humble. On average, the people on Forbes' American billionaire list released Monday have a net worth of $5.7 billion, up from $5 billion last year. Their wealth is so staggering that the magazine had to raise its \"price of admission\" by $25 million to $1.55 billion.  Topping the list are the familiar names of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. But some of the biggest gains went to people who made their fortunes in Silicon Valley.  Mark Zuckerberg is now $19 billion richer than last year. The 30-year-old CEO of Facebook  (FB, Tech30)is worth $34 billion.   27 new inductees in Super-Rich List  Among the 27 new billionaires are tech entrepreneurs Jan Koum, who sold his messaging service What's App to Facebook for $19 billion in February, and Travis Kalanick, the CEO of on-demand car service Uber.  Nicholas Woodman, the founder of wearable camera maker GoPro (GPRO), saw his wealth triple to $3.9 billion after his company went public in June.   Elizabeth Holmes was one of 47 women on the list. Her company, Theranos, is developing a new blood test technology in Palo Alto. She debuts on the list with $4.5 billion.  Gates, Buffett still richer than richest  Gates is the richest man in the country for the 21st year in a row. He stepped down as Microsoft's (MSFT, Tech30) chairman earlier this year, but his wealth has increased by $9 billion to $81 billion.  Legendary investor Warren Buffett is $8.5 billion richer than he was last year. The chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) is worth $67 billion.  Larry Ellison will have more free time to spend his billions now that he has relinquished his CEO title at Oracle (ORCL, Tech30). As the third richest man in America, he is worth $50 billion.  Charles and David Koch, the politically active billionaire brothers, tied for fourth place.  4 from Wal-Mart dynasty are in top 10  Members of the Walton family, heirs to the Wal-Mart  (WMT)fortune, took four of the top 10 spots. Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and media mogul, is the eighth richest man in America.  The richest 400 people in America had their fortunes increase by a total of $270 billion in 2014 to a record $2.29 trillion in combined wealth, according to Forbes.  It would take 597,000 years to make that kind of money   To put that into perspective, it would take the average worker earning the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour 597,000 years to earn the $9 billion that Gates took home this year.  Much of the increase in fortunes this year was related to the \"strength of the U.S. stock market.\"  Two-thirds are self-made   Forbes also introduced this year a new \"self-made score\" to distinguish between those who inherited their wealth from those who earned it the old fashioned way.  According to the new ranking, there was a big increase in the number of self-made billionaires. In 2014, more than two-thirds of the people on the list made their own fortunes. By contrast, more than half were born into wealth just 20 years ago. ", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/29/luxury/richest-billlionaires-forbes/", "author": "Ben Rooney", "date": "NA"},

Sounds great, but there's one catch that's angered investors, who sent shares down 7% Thursday.  JPMorgan, the IPO's underwriter, is letting Woodman's charity sidestep a rule that prohibits insiders from selling stock within the first 180 days of a company's IPO, which could potentially send shares lower.  The bank made an exception and will let the charity sell the shares starting Friday, Oct. 3. That's nearly two months before the lockup period expires late November, which is when GoPro (GPRO) managers and directors can start selling.  GoPro's head honcho just announced his new charity, called the Jill + Nicholas Woodman Foundation, on Wednesday. A press release says that details about its mission will be announced \"at a later date.\"  Related: Is GoPro becoming a movement?   Shares of the extreme-camera maker closed Thursday at $85.40, well above its June IPO price of $24. That makes the gift from Woodman and his wife worth $450 million.

The gift represents a small share of Woodman's holdings; at the time of the IPO he held about 52.4 million shares, according to SEC documents.  GoPro stumbled a bit in early August when it issued its first earnings report, which failed to meet investors' lofty expectations.

{"text": "The only thing more stunning than WhatsApp's $19 billion price tag is the incredible journey of the messaging app's CEO Jan Koum. Koum was raised in Ukraine, immigrating in the early 1990s to the United States when he was a teenager. Living on welfare and food stamps, telephone calls back home to Ukraine proved to be a daunting expense.  Eventually, Skype -- now owned by Microsoft (MSFT) -- changed all that, dramatically reducing the price of international calls. Kuom set out to do the same for text messaging on mobile phones.  By his own account, Koum \"barely graduated\" high school in Mission Viejo, California. He went on to study at San Jose State University, but dropped out. Koum worked at Ernst & Young as a security tester and later became a security and operations engineer at Yahoo (YHOO).  Related: Why WhatsApp is worth $19 billion  In 2009, he founded WhatsApp, a service that has amassed 450 million users in four-plus years and is growing its user base by 1 million people a day.  Despite creating such a wild success, Kuom has shied away from the spotlight. He passes up television appearances and rarely gives interviews. His prestigious CEO title isn't even listed on his social media accounts. On his LinkedIn (LNKD) profile he lists himself as WhatsApps's \"QA Tester.\" He previously said he was the company's \"Sr. Tweet Manager.\"  Koum owns 45% of WhatsApp, according to Forbes. That means when the deal closes with Facebook (FB), his net worth could be close to $7 billion.  Yet Koum remains grounded and is proud of his Ukrainian roots.

La Compagnie will launch its New York to London service in April for around $2,200 return.  That's at least half the price of a business ticket with major carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Air France (AFRAF). La Compagnie already flies from Newark to Paris.  The company says it's able to offer cheap flights by keeping costs down. The firm's headquarters are on the outskirts of Paris, saving on high inner city rents. It also keeps staff numbers low: there are just three cabin crew for each flight, which carry up to 74 passengers.  Related: U.S. airlines eager to fly to Cuba  The airline operates Boeing (BA) 757-200s, a mid-size jetliner also used by Delta Airlines (DAL) and United Airlines. The planes are fitted with flatbeds and individual Samsung (SSNLF) Galaxy tablets to keep passengers entertained. It will run four flights a week to London initially, rising to six by June.

The key to success with corporate travelers is \"network and frequency,\" he said. Time, rather than price, is often more important for them -- and British Airways alone has more transatlantic flights in one day than La Compagnie will offer per week.  \"I think they will struggle,\" Khoo said, \"The [major carriers] have an entrenched advantage of broader route networks and frequency.

{"text": "Donald Trump may be losing business deals left and right, but his stock picking is pretty good. Trump gave the public a glimpse into his investment portfolio on Wednesday, a preliminary disclosure required of presidential candidates in which he also claimed he's worth $10 billion.  Trump's investments aren't all that bold. They are more or less a Who's Who list of America's biggest companies, many of which are listed on the Dow.  Still, many investors would envy his track record. Out of 45 stocks he said he sold through January 2014, Trump lost money on just five stocks. Here are his five biggest stock wins, as measured by percentage gains:  1.) Facebook (199% gain, $3.9 million profit)  2.) Bank of America (135% gain, $6.7 million profit)  3.) Best Buy (113% gain, $2.2 million profit)  4.) Boeing (80% gain, $4 million profit)  5.) Morgan Stanley (75% gain, $750,000 profit)  It's not clear when he purchased the shares, and he didn't say what stocks he currently owns. All told, Trump said his equity investments generated a gain of $27 million.  Related: Trump-branded golf resort files for bankruptcy  Here's what else we know about Donald Trump, the stock picker.  Trump basically owns the Dow: While The Donald comes off as brash in his campaign speeches, his stock picks are relatively tame. Of the shares listed, 16 were part of the Dow 30, including Intel (INTC, Tech30), General Electric (GE) and McDonald's (MCD).  That speaks to Trump's preference for large, multinational companies. Large-cap stocks have performed well during the bull market, though ones with heavy international exposure have been hurt more recently by the strong dollar.  Trump REALLY loves America: Only three of Trump's stock picks were based outside of the U.S.: Enbridge (ENB) (Canada), Noble (NBL) (U.K.) and Volkswagen (VLKAF) (Germany).  That was probably a smart move considering American stocks outperformed their global peers during much of the bull market. However, that patriotic investing strategy has been less lucrative this year. During the first half of 2015, the U.S. ranked 47th among 74 countries in terms of equity performance. While the S&P 500 was virtually flat, stocks in China, Japan and even Argentina soared.  Related: The world's best performing stock markets in 2015  He's not perfect: Trump might not admit it, but even he can make poor decisions.

{"text": "In a play to dominate messaging on phones and the Web, Facebook has acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion. That's a stunning sum for the five-year old company. But WhatsApp has been able to hold its weight against messaging heavyweights like Twitter (TWTR), Google (GOOG) and Microsoft's (MSFT) Skype. WhatsApp has upwards of 450 million users, and it is adding an additional million users every day.  Referring to WhatsApp's soaring growth, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a conference call, \"No one in the history of the world has done anything like that.\"  WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app for smartphones, according to OnDevice Research.  Buying WhatsApp will only bolster Facebook's already strong position in the crowded messaging world. Messenger, Facebook's a standalone messaging app for mobile devices, is second only to WhatsApp in its share of the smartphone market.  Related: 5 key moments that changed Facebook  Similar to traditional text messaging, WhatsApp allows people to connect via their cellphone numbers. But instead of racking up texting fees, WhatsApp sends the actual messages over mobile broadband. That makes WhatsApp particularly cost effective for communicating with people overseas.  That kind of mobile messaging services have become wildly popular, with twice as many messages sent over the mobile Internet than via traditional texts, according to Deloitte. But most of the messaging industry's revenue is still driven by text messaging.  On the conference call, Facebook said it is not looking to drive revenue from WhatsApp in the near term, instead focusing on growth. Zuckerberg said he doesn't anticipate trying to aggressively grow WhatsApp's revenue until the service reaches \"billions\" of users.  WhatsApp currently charges a dollar a year after giving customers their first year of use for free. WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum said on the conference call that WhatsApp's business model is already successful.  That indicates Facebook bought WhatsApp to add value to its existing messaging services, as well as for the long-term potential of the company.  Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 for similar reasons: As young social network users gravitated towards photo-sharing, Facebook wanted to scoop up what could have eventually become a big rival.  Like Instagram, WhatsApp will function as an autonomous unit within Facebook, with all the existing employees coming in as part of the deal.  Facebook (FB) said it will pay WhatsApp $4 billion in cash and $12 billion in stock. WhatsApp's founders and staff will be eligible for for another $3 billion in stock grants to be paid out if they remain employed by Facebook for four years. Koum will also join Facebook's board of directors. ", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/02/19/technology/social/facebook-whatsapp/", "author": "Adrian Covert", "date": "NA"},
{"text": "Jeb Bush kicked off his presidential campaign Monday, vowing to make America back into an \"economic superpower.\" He says that the U.S. can achieve 4% economic growth per year under his watch, and that America would gain 19 million jobs.  \"We made Florida No. 1 in job creation,\" Jeb Bush touted. His promise: \"We will make the United States an economic superpower like no other.\"  Those are lofty goals.  America's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity, was 2.4% in 2014. Since President Obama took office, the economy has added 6.9 million jobs, taking into account the huge job losses during the Great Recession in Obama's first year, according to Labor Department data.  Here's a look at Jeb's record as Florida governor from 1999 to January 2007.  Related: Rand Paul 2016: Breaking down his economic policy   Florida's economic boom: When Bush left office, Florida's unemployment rate was only 3.4%, well below the national unemployment rate then of 4.4%. Florida's unemployment rate today is 5.6%, according to the Labor Department.  Bush championed tax cuts and privatized many government jobs in the state. His tax cuts were widely viewed as a benefit to the wealthy -- they went to businesses and investors. Still, Florida was flush with job growth during his tenure.  Florida's economy rode the housing and tourism boom. The state grew 4.4%, on average, during Bush's years, far ahead of the 3% national growth average during the same time, says Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central Florida.  \"It was pretty strong,\" says Snaith of Florida's economy under Bush. But he notes: \"Florida's economy has a history of boom and bust.\"  Then Florida's economy went bust: The question is how much credit Bush and his policies can take for Florida's economic boom. Or, conversely, how much responsibility should he bear for Florida's downturn shortly after he left office.  Construction -- a pillar to the state's economy -- grew in part because it was easy for home buyers to obtain lots of loan money that they couldn't pay for later.   Related: Hillary Clinton: Good for stocks?   Bush left office -- he couldn't run for a third term -- before Florida's economy collapsed, along with the rest of the American economy. And by some measure, things got worse for Florida than other states.  Consider this: the U.S. economy had one month during the recession when unemployment was 10% or higher. Florida had 27 months above 10% unemployment.  The recession halted job growth for many of Florida's big businesses: construction, tourism and trade, although all three have seen healthy recoveries during past six years.  Bush had been out of office for two years before that downturn began, and it's hard to lay blame on him, says Snaith.

Earlier: NBC to 're-evaluate' Trump's 'Apprentice' role  Trump said it was actually his decision to walk away from the \"Apprentice,\" and that NBC executives were disappointed. At one point, he even posted a private email from the head of the network in order to question the executive's loyalty.  Whatever the circumstances, NBC is free to cast a new host, since the \"Apprentice\" format isn't owned by Trump. It is owned by the prolific reality TV producer Mark Burnett.  When NBC parted ways with Trump, a network statement pointedly said, \"'Celebrity Apprentice' is licensed from Mark Burnett's United Artists Media Group and that relationship will continue.\"  The show could continue with any number of new hosts. Depending on the direction Burnett and NBC want to take, it could seek a former contestant like Omarosa, a larger-than-life billionaire like Mark Cuban (though he is presumably already committed to ABC's rival \"Shark Tank\"), or an established television host like Lopez.

{"text": "Much like the candidates themselves, the tax plans put out by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton could hardly be more different. \"In every meaningful respect these plans are mirror images,\" said Len Burman, director the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which put out its updated analyses of both candidates' plans on Tuesday afternoon.  The new reports incorporate most of the changes Trump and Clinton have made to their original plans in recent months. But directionally, their revisions don't change their broad, opposing courses.  \"Trump has very, very large tax cuts that are primarily focused on high-income individuals. Clinton has a significant tax increase ... almost all of which is focused on very high-income people,\" Burman noted in a call with reporters.  Trump's plan would significantly reduce revenue -- by an estimated $7.2 trillion including interest on the debt in just the first decade and by nearly $21 trillion in the second decade, according to the TPC.  Clinton's plan would raise revenue by an estimated $1.4 trillion in the first 10 years, then by another $2.7 trillion in the second decade.  The TPC has yet to offer its estimates of the effects of each candidate's plan on economic growth, wages and investments. But when those estimates do come out, it may show the revenue losses under Trump's plan and the revenue increases under Clinton's to be less pronounced.  Its current estimates, however, do factor in behavioral effects of taxpayers in response to the proposed changes, such as the potential for tax avoidance.  Trump has tax cuts for most, but ...  The Republican presidential nominee is calling for a wholesale revision of the tax code. In many ways he'd simplify it, but not entirely.  Trump has made a big deal of wanting to cut taxes. His plan would lower income tax rates and reduce today's seven brackets to just three: 12%, 25% and 33%. Today's top rates are much higher, ranging from 28% to 39.6%.   He would increase the standard deduction and repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax, the estate tax and Obamacare -- including the taxes associated with it.  As a result, all income groups on average would see a tax cut. But the rich would benefit far more than anyone else, both in dollars and as a percent of income.  The TPC estimates that those in top 0.1% of households -- who have incomes topping $3.7 million -- would see their tax bill cut by $1.1 million on average, or 14%.  By contrast, those in the very middle of the income distribution would see an average tax cut of $1,010, or 1.8%.  And the poorest of households would see their after-tax income go up by just $110, or less than 1%.  What's more, the report concurs with other tax experts' research that many middle-income single parents and families with a lot of kids would likely see a tax increase under Trump's plan. Here's why: While Trump would increase the standard deduction and add new child care tax breaks, he would also raise the lowest income tax bracket to 12% from 10%, eliminate the head of household status and repeal personal exemptions, which are very valuable to parents.  As a result, many could find that those tradeoffs leave them with a higher tax bill.  The Trump campaign in a statement characterized the Tax Policy Center analysis as \"catastrophically flawed.\" It asserts, among other things, that TPC made incorrect assumptions when analyzing Trump's business tax proposal. And it lambasted the Center for not delaying the report's release until it also could provide a so-called dynamic score that incorporates the plan's economic effects.  Burman noted in his call that the campaign failed to provide guidance on key questions where TPC expressed uncertainty. He also said TPC would release its dynamic score as soon as it can fix a glitch in its scoring model, which could happen in the next week.  Clinton would seriously hike tax burdens on the rich  Unlike Trump, Clinton is not proposing a full overhaul of the tax code. Instead her plan squarely aims to make sure the wealthy pay their \"fair share\" as she defines it.  She'll make the code more complex, particularly for high-income filers who will have to figure out, among other things, if they meet her new Buffett Rule (ensuring the rich pay at least 30% of their income in taxes), and if they are subject to her proposed 4% income surtax on income over $5 million.  Besides those changes, she would raise the estate and gift tax and raise capital gains taxes on stocks held less than six years, among other things. Just this week she proposed an increase in the child tax credit to benefit low- and middle-income families.  Clinton has vowed not to raise taxes on households making less than $250,000. And indeed the TPC estimates nearly all of her tax increases would fall on the top 1% of earners. By contrast, her proposals would slightly increase the after-tax income for low- and middle-income families.  The top 0.1% would see their tax bill go up on average by more than $800,000, or nearly 11%.  By contrast those in the middle of the income distribution would see their tax bill cut by $110, or 0.2%  And those at the bottom would see a tax cut of $100, or 0.7%.  The TPC report notes that those who make between $143,000 and $209,000 might see a small tax increase of 0.1% on average, but not because of changes Clinton proposes to the individual income tax code. Rather, it's due to the assumption that some of her proposed business income tax increases will be borne by investors and workers.  In its response to the report, the Clinton campaign dismissed the Trump plan as the \"most extreme form of trickle down economics.\" The campaign also said Clinton's plan would \"pay for investments in good-paying jobs by requiring the wealthy, Wall Street and large corporations to pay their fair share.\" ", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/11/pf/taxes/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-tax-plans/index.html", "author": "Jeanne Sahadi", "date": "NA"},

Uber drivers are planning to take to the streets on Tuesday as part of a broader protest calling for a $15 hourly minimum wage.  \"Hundreds\" of drivers will protest alongside fast food workers, airport employees and home care aides for what is being billed as a \"Day of Disruption,\" according to Fight for 15, the group organizing the effort.  In San Francisco, Uber's hometown, drivers are planning to march at the airport with signs that say, \"Your Uber Driver is Arriving Striking.\" In other cities, drivers will idle their cars or march with low wage workers from other sectors.  Related: Is Uber's push for self-driving cars a job killer?  \"Everyone says the gig economy is the future of work, but if we want to make that future a bright one, we need to join together like fast-food workers have in the Fight for $15 and demand an economy that works for all,\" Justin Berisie, an Uber driver base in Denver, said in a statement.  Reps for Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Uber has previously said drivers in its top 20 U.S. markets make an average of more than $19 per hour, but that doesn't include \"driver-partners' expenses\" like gas, car repairs and insurance.  Drivers in some cities have also complained that Uber's aggressive fare cuts make it harder to scrape by with those additional costs factored in.  Unlike fast food workers, Uber drivers are considered contractors rather than employees. For that reason, they are not entitled to overtime pay or sick leave.  Fight for 15 has organized protests throughout the country since launching in 2012. New York, California and Washington D.C. have each voted to approve a $15 minimum wage.  The latest \"Fight for $15\" protest takes place just weeks after Donald Trump's victory. The president-elect flip-flopped during the campaign on the issue of raising the minimum wage and suggested the decision should fall to the states rather than the federal government.

{"text": "NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Facebook has agreed to buy photo sharing network Instagram for $1 billion in a combination of cash and stock, the company announced Monday. It's Facebook's biggest acquisition ever, in both price and reach. With around 30 million active users, Instagram has the largest audience of any startup Facebook has purchased, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a blog post.\"We don't plan on doing many more of these, if any at all,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \"But providing the best photo sharing experience is one reason why so many people love Facebook and we knew it would be worth bringing these two companies together.\"Founded in 2010 by Mike Krieger and Kevin Systrom, Instagram has just a handful of employees supporting its wildly popular photo app, which lets users add distinctive filters and visual flair to photos they've snapped on their smartphones. The long-awaited Android version, released last week, racked up more than 1 million downloads in just 12 hours. The launch also met a backlash from iPhone users, who enjoyed having an exclusive hold on the stylish service. Just one month ago, Instagram's creators claimed they had no interest in selling.\"We're pretty focused on remaining an independent company right now,\" Instagram cofounder Systrom told CNNMoney at South by Southwest, where the company delivered a talk on its wild growth.  Even some of Instagram's investors were startled by the takeover. Late last week, Instagram closed a $50 million financing round that valued the company at $500 million, according to a source involved in the deal. Those investors essentially doubled their money, instantly.  Facebook likes to scoop up hot startups, kill their products, and redeploy their staff on other projects. That's definitely not the plan for Instagram, all the players insist.\"It's important to be clear that Instagram is not going away,\" Instagram's founders wrote on their company blog. \"We'll continue to add new features to the product and find new ways to create a better mobile photos experience.\"Zuckerberg pressed the point. \"We're committed to building and growing Instagram independently,\" the CEO said. \"Millions of people around the world love the Instagram app and the brand associated with it, and our goal is to help spread this app and brand to even more people.\"Facebook, which is in the process of going public, ended 2011 with a cash stash just shy of $4 billion. It's paying steep price for a startup that has lots of buzz but no business model. Here's a fun comparison: Yahoo (YHOO, Fortune 500) paid just $35 million seven years ago for Flickr, which remains one of the Web's most popular photo networks. Instagram is a free app and doesn't charge for any of its services. The company's founders insisted that would come in time, once they'd built a sizeable user base. Instagram was their second stab at a product. Before \"pivoting\" to create the wildly popular photo sharing app, the crew was working on a check-in service called Burbn. \"I remember what I'll call 'pivot day.' We sat down and said 'what are we going to work on next? How are we going to evolve this product into something millions of people will want to use?'\" Systrom said last year. \"What is the one thing that makes this product unique and interesting?\" The answer they hit on was \"photo sharing,\" and the result was Instagram. \u00a0", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2012/04/09/technology/facebook_acquires_instagram/", "author": "By Laurie Segall", "date": "NA"},

She also skirts around highly sensitive topics like the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square protests, Chinese President Xi Jinping or even President-elect Donald Trump.  Xiaoice has become hugely popular since she was introduced in 2014. More than 40 million Chinese smartphone users chat with her on the social media platforms WeChat or Weibo every day, according to Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30). A quarter of them have declared their love for her.  Related: After racist tweets, Microsoft muzzles teen chatbot Tay  Companies use chatbots to connect with consumers and promote their brands. Chinese often use Xiaoice simply to have something resembling a real conversation with a close friend.  Xiaoice is an experiment in artificial intelligence. She mines Chinese websites to gather material for conversations. She can glean vital context from voice messages and images. If you send her a photo of a pop star, for example, she might respond by saying how much she likes the singer's music.  Refusing to talk about sensitive topics suggests Xiaoice has been programmed to avoid prohibited words when asked about them. Microsoft declined to comment.  China pours incredible resources into patrolling the internet, tracking down prohibited content and unwanted posts with an army of more than two million censors.  Related: Facebook could pay heavy price if it censors news to please China  To get around them, Chinese bloggers and dissidents get creative. Instead of writing Tiananmen, online users instead reference the date of the massacre -- June 4, 1989 -- often simply writing 64 or 8964.  Xi Jinping is called Xi Baozi, or Steamed Bun Xi, a nickname he earned after a publicity stunt where he bought steamed pork buns at a small store in Beijing and carried his own food tray.  But censors eventually figure out new phrases and nicknames and restrict them online.  China Digital Times recently reported the growing attention to Xiaoice's evasive answers, highlighting tweets from Chinese dissidents like Su Yutong, who lives in Germany. Su tried several banned topics with Xiaoice, posting screengrabs of conversations like the one below on Twitter:  CNNMoney also had a go. We asked Xiaoice about China's president:  And then we name dropped President-elect Donald Trump, and asked her about Tiananmen Square:   Tech giants such as  Facebook (FB, Tech30), Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and Google (GOOGL, Tech30) are blocked in China, in part because the government fears open discussions about the very topics Xiaoice refuses to acknowledge.  Amnesty International has documented a marked uptick in censorship in China over the past year, including an increase in controls on social media.  Related: China holds 'World Internet Conference' as censorship intensifies  Microsoft still operates in China, and has been criticized in the past for complying with the country's strict policing of the Internet.  If Microsoft has programmed Xiaoice to sidestep sensitive topics, it indicates a worrisome trend, said Patrick Poon, an Amnesty researcher. Earlier this week, Facebook was reported to have built a censorship tool to get into China.  \"They are legitimizing what the Chinese government is doing, which is convincing foreign tech companies to suppress freedom of speech,\" Poon said.  -- Tim Schwarz and Serena Dong contributed this story.

{"text": "Outta the way Charles Darwin! It's Jane Austen's time to shine. The Bank of England announced Wednesday it's updating the design of its \u00a310 notes, replacing the face of famous evolutionary scientist Darwin with novelist Austen, who penned 'Pride and Prejudice'.  \"Jane Austen certainly merits a place in the select group of historical figures to appear on our banknotes,\" said the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney. \"Her novels have an enduring and universal appeal and she is recognized as one of the greatest writers in English literature.\"  Born in 1775 in Hampshire, England, Austen was a prolific writer known for her wit and observations of social life in the 19th century. She is considered one of the most famous Britons, and her works are required reading for students around the world.  Austen joins the likes of economist Adam Smith and 19th century prison reformer Elizabeth Fry, whose faces have been featured on British banknotes.  Related: U.K. honors Churchill with new \u00a35 note  The central bank recently sparked some controversy after announcing that the face of wartime leader Winston Churchill would adorn the new \u00a35 note starting in 2016, replacing Elizabeth Fry. That would have left all British bills dominated by male mugs.  The bank was very clear that it did not intend to exclude women.  \"We acknowledge the concerns that have been raised recently about the diversity of characters on the notes, and would like to provide reassurance that, as part of the rolling program of note launches, it was never the Bank's intention that none of the four characters on our notes would be a woman,\" stated the bank in a press release.  Related: Meet your new $100 bill  This led the Bank of England to do some soul-searching and the governor announced the central bank would conduct a formal review of the process for choosing characters to appear on banknotes. The review will help ensure the bills represent and celebrate \"the full diversity of great British historical figures,\" he said.  The central bank plans to print and distribute the new \u00a310 bills, featuring Austen, starting in 2017.  At last count, there were more than 750 million \u00a310 bills in circulation.  The Bank of England began promoting eminent Britons on the reverse side of its notes in 1970. The front is reserved for an image of the monarch.

From delays to cancellations to overbooked flights, more than 26 million people experience airline grievances every year. More than 8 million of them are eligible for compensation as a result, but less than 2% get the money they're entitled to.  \"When airlines say, 'Sorry, it's due to weather,' they have to prove it,\" said Nicolas Michaelsen, co-founder of AirHelp.   On overbooked flights, for example, many fliers are willing to accept vouchers. But they might actually be entitled to much more.  Related: Feds take on airlines over high ticket prices  AirHelp has a fully automated system that deciphers the validity of a claim based on everything from flight info to air traffic control data.  By entering basic flight information on AirHelp's app or website, passengers can find out if they're eligible for compensation within minutes. (Or, there's an option to link an email account and AirHelp will keep constant tabs on whether you're owed money from a flight.)  AirHelp launched in Copenhagen in 2013 but now operates in 17 countries. On average, customers get $450 per claim. AirHelp gets a 25% cut of the payout -- it only makes money when its passengers do.  CNNMoney's Upstart 30: The Funders  Completing the process can take 4 to 10 weeks. \"Sometimes we get the money after two minutes. Sometimes we have to go to court to get it,\" said Michaelsen, 32, who is based in New York City.  That's why AirHelp, an alum of Y Combinator, has 15 lawyers on its 70-person team.  \"When we open up a new country, we have to take a number of claims to court to show we're there and we mean business. Then when that's done, they respect [AirHelp] more,\" he said.  Fliers aren't the only ones who can benefit from AirHelp's technology.  Airlines could save an estimated $324 million a year if they used AirHelp to validate claims, said Michaelsen.  CNNMoney's Upstart 30: The Simplifiers  Airlines are manually processing claims, which takes time, resulting in a backlog. According to AirHelp, airlines owe passengers $10 billion in backlogged claims from the past three years. (Three years is the amount of time a claim remains valid.)  So, which airline has had the most claims filed against them? That's Ryan Air, according to AirHelp's data.  The friendliest carrier?

{"text": "It's a common dream -- get paid while traveling the world. Two startups are helping people make this happen. The only catch: you bring the job.  Earlier this week, 75 people (mostly young, mostly techies) showed up in Prague for a month's stay. While there, they'll do their regular day jobs from a shared workspace. In the off time, they'll be free to explore the country.  After Prague, it's off to Slovenia. Then Croatia. Then Istanbul. Ultimately, they'll spend a month each in 12 locations around the world -- living, working and traveling together throughout Europe, Asia and South America.  \"A lot of people want to do this, but they don't because it's scary,\" said Greg Caplan, founder of Remote Year, the company running the program.  So Caplan makes it easier. He charges each person $2,000 a month, which gives them access to a shared work space, their own room and all travel tickets once they reach Prague.  \"Productivity has gone to the cloud,\" said Caplan, 26. \"You don't need to be at a certain desk anymore, or in a certain city anymore.\"  Related: Half work, half vacation: meet the 'work-cation'   Obviously, the program isn't for everybody. The biggest barrier is having a job that allows you to work remotely -- and also pays relatively well. Caplan figures about $45,000 a year is needed to pay his fee and have enough left to live comfortably. That's a lot, but it's probably less than many professionals spend each year in a big U.S. city.  Most of the participants are web developers, digital marketers and the like. But there's also a handful of writers, accountants and lawyers. One woman works in sales, and simply makes her calls to Michigan during evening hours. The average age is 30, though people range from 22 to 49.  Americans make up over half the group, with the rest coming from India, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and various European countries.  Cassie Utt, a 24-year old IT professional, convinced her bosses at Eaton -- a 100-year-old maker of industrial equipment -- to let her do Remote Year. She said the trip would let her build relationships in the firm's many foreign offices, and noted that it wouldn't cost the company anything extra.  \"I had anticipated this being a difficult sell and put together a lengthy business proposal,\" said Utt. \"Oddly enough, it wasn't.\"  So she let the lease lapse on her car and apartment, put her stuff in storage and bought a new suitcase, web cam and phone headset.  This is the first trip organized by Remote Year, and Caplan said he's making just enough money to cover the yearly expenses for himself and his five employees living abroad with him.   He said 25,000 people applied for the 75 slots. He was looking for a diverse group of people and those who would be successful working remotely. He narrowed it down with individual essays and Skype interviews.  Related: Here's what came next after she sold her site for $23 million  Establishing a community while traveling was a theme Caplan kept returning to, and it's central to one of Caplan's competitors as well.  Hacker Paradise was formed in 2014 after co-founder Casey Rosengren, a web developer and marketer, wanted to travel in Central America but was hesitant to leave his community in New York.  \"Typically, when you travel, you're surrounded by the backpacking crowd and people partying every night,\" said Rosengren, 24. \"It's not really conducive to work.\"  So he called up some pals, posted ads on tech boards, and soon had 15 people headed to Costa Rica for a three-month stay. Having that group of people together, with everyone feeding off each other's ideas, fostered more productivity and creativity in everyone, he said.  \"It started out as a hobby, but the people had such a good time, and got so much out of it, we couldn't not do it again.\"  Southeast Asia was next, and last week the third trip started in Europe.  Hacker Paradise is a bit more informal than Remote Year. It costs $750 a month, but only covers the workspace and various activities. Trips are generally for three months, and people can come and go as they please.  Rosengren said over 300 people applied for 30 slots. Like Caplan, he's only making enough to cover his expenses, but he has plans to expand the program.  \"There seems to be so much need for community around travelers,\" he said. \"It's a lot like freshman year at university.\" ", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/08/technology/work-travel/index.html", "author": "Steve Hargreaves", "date": "NA"},

Here are his two addresses. ...\"  Spencer is a leader of the white nationalist movement and president of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think-tank. He organized a conference of white supremacists last weekend in Washington, D.C., that drew national attention after a video showed people in attendance celebrating President-elect Donald Trump with Nazi salutes.

All visitors need is something they can't lose \u2014 their face. Baidu, a Chinese tech company, began testing facial recognition technology last week in Wuzhen, a historic town with classic canals and architecture. The area receives millions of visitors each year.  The technology has shortened wait times and added convenience for guests. So far feedback has been positive, according to Baidu (BIDU, Tech30) and the Wuzhen Tourism Co.  When a visitor arrives, their photo is taken and uploaded to a database. When he or she attempts to access certain parts of the town, a tablet attached to the entry gates records video. It then send a few frames to the cloud, where artificial intelligence identifies if the person seeking access is authorized. This all happens in 0.6 of a second, according to Baidu. The technology is accurate 99.77% of the time.   \"You always have your face with you,\" Baidu chief scientist Andrew Ng told CNNMoney. \"Facial recognition, while not a panacea, has a lot of strengths that other authentication methods don't.\"  Related: FBI's facial-recognition system searchers 411 million images  Using biometrics for authorization is nothing new. Fingerprint scanners have long been used, but they aren't always effective. For example, it's harder to authorize on older users due to how aging changes fingertips.  Meanwhile, some iris-scanning technology can be tricked by printing out a photo of a human eye. Baidu's technology, however, detects when a person isn't live so someone can't beat the system.  Baidu isn't the only company using a person's face for authentication. Microsoft lets users sign into some of its Surface tablets with facial recognition technology.  In September, Uber began requiring U.S. drivers to snap a selfie before their first ride of the day to prevent fraud and protect drivers' accounts. If the photo a driver submits doesn't match what's on file, Uber will block the account until the situation is resolved.  MasterCard has tested using facial recognition to verify its cardholders' identities and make online shopping easier. It will formally launch its program in the first half of 2017, according to a spokeswoman.  Ng said Baidu will allow partners to use its technology, too. One partner is already developing a way to use it to enter the home. Rather than relying on a physical key or punching a code into a door, the door would automatically unlock once a person -- with granted access -- approaches. Ng imagines this will be useful for short-term rentals.  He also sees facial recognition technology as a way to prevent ticket scalping. When you buy a ticket to an event, organizers could require an image of your face and then verify it when you attempt to enter the venue.  Another way Baidu is using the tech: to help Chinese partners grant loans to customers via smartphones. The company uses facial recognition technology to confirm who is using the phone, rather relying on a password.

{"text": "Populism is sweeping the nation, but it's likely just getting started. Donald Trump's win is a wake-up call that voters are angry with a system that's made middle-class jobs tougher to come by, and increased inequality.  As pronounced as the trend already is, it's only just the beginning, experts say. Looming technological advances will wipe out more jobs, broadening the base of disenfranchised, unemployable and frustrated citizens. Meanwhile, elites with the skills to flourish in the digital economy will get richer. And governments will have to figure out how to help struggling citizens.  Trump has suggested bringing back jobs to the U.S. from overseas. But even if these jobs return, they may soon vanish in a tide of automation.  Manufacturing jobs aren't the only ones at risk. Pizza delivery guys, garbagemen, radiologists, retail workers, truck drivers, call-center workers and cab drivers are among the most obvious casualties.  The World Economic Forum has estimated that five millions jobs will be lost by 2020. A 2013 Oxford study estimated that 47% of U.S. employment is at risk of being computerized. Economist Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary, expects that more than one in three men in their prime working years will be out of work in 2050.   The technology world is going through tremendous advances in artificial intelligence that are powering everything from self-driving cars to apps that help diagnose cancer. Many benefits await society. The change is so profound that some have started to call artificial intelligence the new electricity. But like all technologies, it's a double-edged sword, and a lot of people are about to get shocked.  \"It's going to get worse. The inequality will get worse. There's going to be more anger and social upheaval,\" said Martin Ford, author of Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future. \"What we're seeing is in large measure because of technology.\"  Related: Amazon only needs one minute of human labor to ship your next package  Trump ran on issues of immigration and trade. Ford argues this is because it's easiest for people to point a finger at another person, be it a worker in China or an immigrant.  The true culprit, as Ford sees it, is new technologies that have made it increasingly possible to automate traditional middle class jobs. The education required to hold down a middle class gig is increasing. There are new jobs, but most don't guarantee the lifestyle of yesteryear. Median American wages have been flat for decades, even as the country's economy grows -- concentrating wealth in fewer hands.  \"We talked 20, 25 years ago about the need for more than a high school education,\" said David Colburn, a history professor at the University of Florida. \"Now we're talking about the need for more than a community college education. And in some cases, we're talking about a greater need than just a college education.\"  We're already seeing signs of how unemployment could run rampant, triggering a broader populist backlash.  This week, Domino's began delivering pizzas with drones in New Zealand. When an autonomous drone can make deliveries, there's little need for humans to drive cars or trucks. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) also is investing heavily in drone delivery. And Starbucks (SBUX) has reportedly talked with Google (GOOGL, Tech30) about delivering coffee via drone.  Car and tech companies like Google, Uber, Ford (F), Toyota (TM), Intel (INTC, Tech30), Daimler, Samsung and GM (GM) are investing in autonomous vehicle technology. This October, Budweiser delivered beer in Colorado thanks to a self-driving truck.  Related: Is Uber's push for self-driving cars a job killer?  Our shift to the convenience and low prices of online shopping also risks accelerating these trends. Retail jobs are already shifting from brick and mortar stores to e-commerce warehouses.  While new jobs may sound like a good thing, this is actually dangerous for workers' job security. Warehouse work is far easier for a machine to learn, according to Ford. It's much simpler for a robot to learn to box up a package in an Amazon fulfillment center, rather than standing at a Macy's checkout counter, making small talk with a customer. Warehouses are controlled, predictable environments -- brick and mortar stores are not.  So what do we do about this? We could try and bring factories back from overseas, as Trump has suggested. Yet much of the work available in factories appears to have a shelf life due to robots' increasing capabilities.  Some are suggesting that governments pay citizens a regular stipend, a concept called a universal basic income.  Related: Google drones deliver Chipotle burritos at Virginia Tech  \"The universal consensus from the smartest people in the world is that universal basic income is a given,\" said John Marshall, chief innovation officer at Lippincott, a creative consultancy that convenes expert panels for its clients on issues such as basic income. \"It's something that society won't be able to function without.\"  Yet figuring out how such a system could be afforded -- and not turn a country into a nation of slackers -- is unclear. Several countries, including Finland and the Netherlands, are taking the concept seriously.  \"I don't think we're anywhere near the brainpower we need focused on this problem to solve it,\" Ford said.

{"text": "Confession: I'm a bit of a control freak. I don't, for example, enjoy riding in cars driven by other people. Cars driven by no people? Forget about it.  Needless to say, I wasn't thrilled when Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU, Tech30) offered me a chance to ride shotgun in a car driven by a computer.  But I was able to put my unease aside, for journalism's sake, and agreed to take Baidu's new driverless car for a spin in Wuzhen, a city located roughly 130 kilometers west of Shanghai.  The car is called Yun Xiao, or \"Cloud Ride,\" and it doesn't look like much. It appears to be a very typical sedan, in fact, until you notice the Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) device perched on its roof. (Think radar, but with lasers.)  The gizmo spins constantly, scanning the car's surroundings with sensors and cameras that act as the car's eyes.  \"Everything it is scanning is fed into the car's computer and compressed and analyzed in real time,\" said Wesley Shao, a senior project engineer who rode along for the test drive. \"It's scanning for anything that is 3-D detectable.\"  What's \"3-D detectable?\" That's anything we might be able to crash into.   Related: Baidu is bringing AI chatbots to healthcare  But the car followed all the rules of the road. There wasn't much traffic to contend with, but it stayed within the lines, stopped at a red light and even made a proper U-turn.  It feels like advanced technology, and that's because it is. But Baidu says there's a long way to go before this car is ready for the public.  \"Right now this car is like a novice driver, if you compare it to human drivers,\" said Wang Jing, who leads the company's autonomous car project. \"Our goal is to make it better than any human driver in the world.\"  But it won't be long before these cars are saving lives, he said.  \"We are trying very hard to show the real capability that an autonomous driving car is actually safer than a human driver,\" said Wang, who claimed the project is Baidu's largest-ever internal investment.  Major tech and auto companies including Uber, Google (GOOGL, Tech30), Tesla (TSLA), BMW (BAMXF), Daimler, and Ford (F) are also working feverishly to develop their own autonomous cars.  Related: Ford and Baidu invest in self-driving car technology  Baidu's goal is to have a small number of functional driverless cars on the roads by 2018. Mass production could begin as soon as 2021. Wang said a majority of cars produced in the year 2026 could be autonomous.  Research firm IHS Automotive predicts there will be 21 million such cars on the road by 2035. Another estimate by the Boston Consulting Group estimated the driverless car industry could be worth $77 billion per year by 2035.  As for me, I'm not ready to give up control of the wheel and gas pedal just yet.  A recent survey commissioned by Kelly Blue Book showed that 51% of people agree, even if it means making other drivers less safe.  If Baidu can change our minds, they'll be on their way to major profits.

{"text": "President Obama handed out Presidential Medals of Freedom on Tuesday, to a glittering class of recipients that included actors and athletes, rock stars and business pioneers. While the mood was celebratory and festive, it was hard not to think that such events are likely to take a significant turn as the nation prepares to shift into a new phase of the culture wars amid a Donald Trump presidency -- from the warm feelings on display toward a big chill.  Hollywood and the arts are well known for their liberal leanings, and entertainment heavyweights came out in force for Hillary Clinton's candidacy. Bruce Springsteen, one of Tuesday's honorees, was among the many who performed to support her. Robert De Niro, another recipient, labeled Trump \"an embarrassment to this country\" before the election.  Trump has traveled in celebrity circles, including his interactions with a wide assortment of the famous -- or in some cases, notorious -- hosting \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" But the tone and content of his campaign was especially hostile toward -- and elicited commensurate condemnation from -- so-called media elites, many of which were angered and alarmed by perceived appeals to racism and xenophobia.  Moreover, Trump added fuel to that fire over the weekend via Twitter, demanding an apology from the cast of the musical \"Hamilton\" for its public appeal to Vice President-elect Mike Pence and directing additional criticism at \"Saturday Night Live\" for satirizing him.  Related: 'Hamilton' star to Trump: 'There's nothing to apologize for'  Those in the arts and other high-profile endeavors, by contrast, have warmly embraced Obama, due both to his policies and the historic nature of his election. His ease in these settings was evident during his remarks Tuesday, which included teasing basketball great Michael Jordan for having become an internet meme, gushing about actress Cicely Tyson and lauding Ellen DeGeneres for having the courage to so publicly come out as a lesbian almost 20 years ago.  It's worth noting, too, that Obama was born near the end of the baby-boom generation, and his entertainment tastes and sports idols have reflected those values. Like most people in their 50s, he didn't need cue cards or prompting to croon Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together,\" as he did a few years ago at the Apollo Theater.  These occasions are largely ceremonial, and one more is scheduled before the year's over: the annual Kennedy Center Honors. That star-studded program will again be televised by CBS and hosted by Stephen Colbert, who, along with most of the late-night landscape, has turned political comedy into hostile territory for the President-elect.  While it's normally difficult to reject the siren song of Washington, given the polarized political climate, many of the luminaries recognized at these events won't readily line up to have their pictures taken with the President during a Trump administration. And one suspects there will be similar reticence within the ranks of NFL and NBA stars, whose teams traditionally celebrate championships with, among other things, a trip to the White House.  Those feeling wistful about the end of Obama's presidency will likely find weightier matters to contemplate than whether celebrities are comfortable visiting the White House. Still, watching him interact with the honorees Tuesday felt like a tangible demonstration, on that front, of the end of an era.

{"text": "It's a special kind of terror when you almost crash the Batmobile. Well, really, it wasn't that close of a call. But then this wasn't just any Batmobile. This was the original.  It wasn't one of those matte black military-looking machines from the movies. It wasn't driven by a brooding and emotionally conflicted Batman with visible emotional scars.  This was the Batmobile from the 1960s TV show, shiny with neon orange stripes. It was driven by my childhood hero, the comically uptight, painfully polite defender of the good citizens of Gotham as played by Adam West.  I sat in the same seat Adam West sat in. It felt pretty cool, and I was the only journalist who got the opportunity. I drove the same Batmobile I watched him drive in \"Batman\" reruns over 40 years ago. There were others made for the show that he would have also driven but this was the first.  It's for sale. Asking price: $5 million.  And I almost ran it off the road. You see, the Batmobile, like the aging TV star it is, is in kind of rough shape. It's tough to get replacement parts for what was, in 1955, an experimental concept car built by Ford (F). Back then, it was called the Lincoln Futura.   In 1965, master Hollywood car customizer George Barris, bought the Futura and turned it into the Batmobile.  In 2013, Barris sold the car at a Barrett-Jackson collector car auction for a total of $4.6 million, including fees, to an Arizona collector. That collector, who has asked not be named, has decided he's had it long enough. It's not being auctioned but Barrett-Jackson is, again, handing the sale, this time as a simple retail transaction. (As in, if you're interested, give them a call.) They let me spend about half a day driving the car in a closed desert location.  The Batmobile V8 engine still runs and makes a heavy rumble you wouldn't have heard on TV. Today, it hesitates to start at times and it had to be jump-started once during my day with it. (I imagined Batman by the side of the road. \"Pardon me, good citizen. I'm sorry to interrupt you on your important business, but could you assist me with these Bat-Jumper-Cables?\")  It drove straight and the steering wheel worked with the expected old-American-car sloppiness.  The brakes are, by modern standards, less than heroic. I quickly learned to press on the brake pedal like I was trying to crush an alligator to death with my foot. The Batmobile would stop after a while.  So there I was, following behind a Toyota Corolla carrying a cameraperson and a fellow from Barrett-Jackson, the company selling the car. He was carrying a fire extinguisher. It was just a precaution, I was assured.  Photos - Cool cars from the Frankfurt Motor Show   The shoulder of the Batmobile's left wing blocked my vision on one side, the black bar arching along the top blocked it on the other. In front of me, the scorching Arizona sun fractured and glinted through a scratched plastic bubble windshield that also warped everything ahead.  After a while, I'd gotten used to the view, so I decided to go ahead and see what the Batmobile could really do. I let the Corolla gain some distance and I gunned it. The engine roared, the car's bat nose lifted up a little and and I closed up fast on the Corolla.  Then the Corolla made a left turn I hadn't expected. I had to stay with it so I slammed on the brake pedal to slow down. This time, the brakes decided to work.  The wheels locked up, making a squealing sound just like a TV chase scene. With the car sliding toward the roadside gravel, I eased off the brakes a little to let the tires get back their grip and guided the Batmobile through the widest turn I could make without running off the pavement.  I had saved the Batmobile from my own impetuousness and I had found out what the Batmobile can do. It can do pretty well for a superhero that's 50 years old and then some.

{"text": "Wix wants to help boutique hotels, bed and breakfasts, and vacation rentals take control of their web presence. On Wednesday, the cloud-based web development company launched WixHotels, a booking engine that allows hotels to manage their own inventory without paying commission to one of the big aggregators like Expedia (EXPE), Orbitz (OWW) or Priceline (PCLN, Tech30).  The goal is for smaller hotel and vacation rental owners to be able to \"compete effectively with the giants of the industry,\" according to Wix (WIX) co-founder Avishai Abrahami.  Right now, hotels' online visibility relies heavily on aggregators, which can be costly for boutique businesses.  \"The high cost and commissions taken by existing booking engines and booking websites is a major factor in why users will switch to WixHotels,\" said Abrahami.  Sites like Expedia can charge as much as a 30% commission on the room price, according to hospitality expert Larry Mogelonsky.  Expedia declined requests for comment.  Related: Banks won't lend? Use these guys instead  Wix has 50 million registered users -- both businesses and individuals -- who have created their own web and mobile sites with Wix's drag and drop utilities (no coding experience required). Roughly 10,000 of Wix's customers are running hotel sites. Many rely on the costly booking aggregators -- and some have no digital booking system at all.  \"We began investigating the needs of this vertical about five months ago,\" explained Abrahami. \"When realizing the gap in the market, we began development.\"  Since its soft launch last week, he said they've already had thousands of implementations. For now, WixHotels is free to web clients, but like other Wix features, it will likely be based on a freemium model, meaning additional features will cost more. Websites through Wix end up costing customers between $7 and $50 a month, depending to the features added.  Related: Facebook says: If you Like it, Buy it.   A seamless, full-service web experience is essential in the travel industry.  According to a 2013 report by Google (GOOG), 65% of customers book travel directly on company sites instead of online travel agencies like Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz. It's an 11% increase from 2012.  Pablo Techera owns Reina Mora Guest House, a five-room hotel in Spain. He runs his website through Wix and previously had just a basic contact form and a phone number for reservations. He was one of a few hotels that helped Wix test the product during a pilot period.  \"It's all together, our site and our booking engine,\" said Techera. \"We're free to just care for our guests.\"  Techera is likely in the minority, though, according to Mogelonsky, who's skeptical of the need for Wix's product.  Mogelonsky estimates that just \".001\" of the hotel industry population don't have systems currently in place, and they're likely hotels with a very small number of rooms.  \"We don't know a person who doesn't have a property management system,\" explained Mogelonsky. \"There's no critical mass here.\" ", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/08/06/smallbusiness/wix-hotel-booking/index.html", "author": "Sara Ashley O'Brien", "date": "NA"},

{"text": "The FBI has a sprawling face-recognition program that can search more than 411.9 million images of faces, including driver's license, visa and passport databases, according the Government Accountability Office. A new report by the government watchdog agency released Wednesday gives an unprecedented look at the scale of the FBI's facial recognition programs.  The report criticizes the FBI for not giving the public adequate information about the programs and their privacy implications, as required under the 1974 federal Privacy Act. It also says the systems have not been sufficiently tested for accuracy.  The report reveals for the first time that the FBI has an internal unit called Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation (FACE). In addition to accessing the FBI's known Next Generation Identification (NGI) database of almost 30 million mugshots and civil photos, FACE can search photos stored in other federal and state databases.  Related: FBI launches a face recognition system   It includes access to the Department of State's database of passport and visa applications, and driver's license databases for 16 states. Currently, the FBI is negotiating with 18 additional states to access their databases.  Last month, the FBI asked that its database be exempt from some parts of the Privacy Act. The NGI program also collects other biometric data including fingerprints and iris scans. Outside law enforcement agencies can also request searches of the database.  GAO recommended the Attorney General look into why required privacy impact reports were not published by the FBI. It also asked the FBI to conduct tests on the system to determine its accuracy and false positive rates, hold annual reviews of the NGI system and audit each database used by the FACE system to determine if they're accurate enough for FBI searches.  In its reply to the report, the Department of Justice said any photos returned as possible matches are not considered positive identification, and are not sufficient to warrant action on their own. It's only used for \"investigative leads,\" according to the DoJ.  The GAO investigation was requested by U.S. Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota.  \"Facial recognition technology is a new and powerful tool that holds great promise for law enforcement. But if we don't ensure its accuracy and guard against misuse, I am concerned about the risk of innocent Americans being inadvertently swept up in criminal investigations,\" said Franken in a statement.

{"text": "In the wee hours of Thursday morning, 51,744 cans of Budweiser received an escort worthy of a president. Otto, a startup Uber bought this summer, used one of its autonomous trucks to complete a 120-mile trek in Colorado, which the companies are calling the first commercial delivery using a self-driving truck.  The truck cruised down Interstate 25 with an empty driver's seat. The human who piloted the truck from Anheuser-Busch to the highway shifted to the back of the cab until the truck exited the highway.  Before the trip even began, two tow trucks drove the route to make sure no vehicles were parked on the highway.  The driverless tractor-trailer was sandwiched between four Colorado state patrol cars and three vehicles from Otto. In one patrol car sat the executive director of Colorado's department of transportation, Shailen Bhatt.  The state had overcome its reservations about the trip after Otto repeatedly drove the route autonomously with a human behind the wheel, who never had to intervene.  Related: Is Uber's push for self-driving cars a job killer?  \"This is a big deal. Transportation is being transformed by technology,\" Bhatt told CNNMoney. \"For me, it comes back to this: Technology can help us save lives.\"  The test was months in the making. This spring, Anheuser-Busch (AHBIF), which makes Budweiser, reached out to Otto, then a highly regarded self-driving truck startup. The brewer was interested in how self-driving trucks could help its operation. Each year, its beer travels 450 million miles on U.S. roads.  \"We're eager to begin to scale this,\" said James Sembrot, senior director of logistics strategy at Anheuser-Busch. \"I see a future where this technology becomes ubiquitous, it becomes similar to automatic transmission or cruise control.\"  Otto and Anheuser-Busch did not pinpoint when they see the technology being used regularly and without police convoys. They'll need to receive regulatory approval too. In Colorado, it's a gray area, according to Bhatt.  Both pointed to autonomous technology as a way to improve road safety and make transportation more sustainable. They anticipate self-driving trucks will use fuel more efficiently than humans, because they will drive the speed limit and anticipate looming traffic jams rather than slamming on their brakes.  Related: What it's like to ride in a self-driving Uber  Some experts have warned that autonomous trucks will lead to mass unemployment for truck drivers.  Lior Ron, Otto's cofounder, sees drivers and autonomous trucks working in harmony. The human will become a copilot, taking breaks while the truck drives. Ultimately, Ron said, the truck will be more productive for more hours of the day.  For Bhatt, self-driving trucks are also a promising way to limit congestion.  \"If we work to perfect technology, we can shift a lot of these freight hauls to the dead of night and take advantage of our Interstate system when it's underused,\" he said.  Bhatt said the successful delivery wasn't the only productive part of the trip. Colorado state patrol encountered and apprehended a drunk driver en route.

{"text": "For years, Tesla has watched as competitors surged ahead of it, hitting milestones and earning acclaim for progress toward self-driving vehicles. But now Tesla is doubling down on a self-driving car strategy that its competitors can't match. Analysts say the unique, risky approach could push Tesla ahead of competitors, or end in failure.  Tesla announced Thursday that all of its vehicles being produced have the hardware to be fully self-driving. Some Tesla vehicles already have autopilot, which is akin to a sophisticated cruise control. But with fully self-driving vehicles, which require more sensors and cameras, Tesla could trigger a revolution in how we get around. Autonomous cars are widely expected to improve road safety and broaden access to transportation.  There's one catch -- Tesla's vehicle won't be shipping with the software needed to drive on their own. Tesla, which updates its cars remotely as if they were smartphones, will gradually send over-the-air updates as it shifts toward full autonomy.  Tesla will fine-tune its self-driving software in a \"shadow mode\" on the thousands of Tesla cars on roads around the world. The company will be essentially crowdsourcing the improvement of its self-driving technology. As the software runs in the background on Tesla cars, the company's engineers will track how the self-driving software would operate if it were in control of the vehicle. Then they'll make corrections to improve the system.  Tesla's competitors -- including Google (GOOG), the leader in the self-driving field -- simply can't match this approach. Google, for example, isn't an automaker so it has to rely on test drivers. Traditional automakers like Ford (F) and GM (GM) have cars on the road, but they can't crowdsource like Tesla because their vehicles lack self-driving hardware and over-the-air updates.  \"What Tesla is doing, and their ability to continue to upgrade the system, it gives them the ability to catch up, and it gives them real-world testing and data collection at a huge level,\" said Mike Ramsey, a research director at Gartner.  Related: Is Uber's push for self-driving cars a job killer?  Tesla also has an edge in that it's willing to take on more risk than competitors.  \"I don't think Tesla minds that they can put the car out without having it be a finished product,\" Ramsey said. \"It is something that Google and GM and others just refuse to do. They feel like it has to reach a perfection level.\"  Fei-Fei Li, director of Stanford's AI lab, said Tesla's decision to outfit its car with self-driving hardware is a visionary move that's preparing it for the future.  \"The race to self-driving cars has begun,\" Li said. \"But the journey is still long.\"  It's unclear if Tesla's plan will work, and when it could match competitors such as Google and Uber.  Tesla is forgoing the use of a LIDAR sensor, an expensive component, which many in the industry feel is essential to making a safe self-driving car. By not using LIDAR, Tesla can keep its costs down. The fully autonomous software package will cost Tesla owners an extra $8,000.  Related: Tesla driver killed in autopilot crash said the tech was great  The potential danger for Tesla is that its self-driving software updates won't work well enough, and there will be a rash of high-profile crashes, such as the death of Joshua Brown, an Ohio man who died in May while driving his Tesla in autopilot mode. A backlash may trigger regulators to step in and crack down on the self-driving car industry.  \"It's totally risky what they doing,\" Ramsey said. \"At the same time, it's kind of revolutionary in the way car companies do things.\"  Tesla's risk tolerance has already played a role in a messy break-up with Mobileye, the company it previously partnered with on its self-driving technology. Mobileye said it would no longer work with Tesla, citing concerns over the reputation of autonomous driving.  But if Tesla's approach succeeds, skepticism will evaporate quickly and Tesla will be the trendsetter.  \"If this works, everyone will have to do it,\" Ramsey said. \"They will have to do it, or adopt at least sections of it, or they will be left behind.\" ", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/20/technology/tesla-autopilot-self-driving/index.html", "author": "Matt McFarland", "date": "NA"},

{"text": "Turns out, contract workers might not be the answer to the on-demand economy. On Monday, grocery delivery startup Instacart announced a new option for some of its contract workers: become an employee.  This comes after last week's ruling that one San Francisco Uber driver is, in fact, an employee. The finding is shining a spotlight on Uber and hoards of other startups that rely on contract workers.  Since launching in 2012, Instacart has used contractors to pick up and deliver groceries to customers.  But starting Monday, some of Instacart's Chicago workers can choose to be part-time employees. This just applies to the \"personal shoppers\" who pick out items for customers; its drivers will remain contract workers for now.  Instacart's decision to explore an employee model came before the Uber finding. The startup -- which has raised $275 million in venture capital and is valued at $2 billion -- has been experimenting with part-time employees in a Boston pilot since February.  \"The data showed that this change improved the quality and efficiency of order picking and made for a better customer experience,\" said Instacart founder and CEO Apoorva Mehta in a press release.  It's something that cleaning startup Managed by Q realized from the beginning: In order to deliver quality service, it needed to be the best employer. And that meant hiring workers and offering benefits, sick leave and flexible work hours.  \"The general rule of thumb I've heard -- which resonates with our experience -- is that employees are 25%-30% more expensive than independent contractors,\" said Dan Teran, co-founder of Managed by Q. That varies depending on things like benefits and employee training.  For Instacart, the biggest upfront costs will be worker's comp and payroll expenses, according to Instacart spokeswoman Andrea Saul.  \"[But] we think it'll be worth it to deliver better service,\" said Saul, who notes that they're now able to perform management trainings and provide more quality control.  The wages Instacart pays its employees vary by market -- Saul said they pay more than local minimum wages, said Saul. As employees, they'll be eligible for unemployment, social security and Medicare.  Most Instacart \"shoppers\" work between 24 and 30 per week. With the new policy, part-time workers won't be able to work more than 30 hours a week, as that tips them into the full-time bucket, which mandates healthcare coverage.  Instacart anticipates that 75% of its shoppers will opt for part-time employee status (based on the pilot findings.)  Shannon Liss-Riordan, a labor lawyer who is representing Uber drivers in a separate case, said she was \"very happy\" to hear of Instacart's move.  \"Instacart is one of the major players in the area. I hope more companies come to this realization and that this is part of a trend we may be seeing,\" she said.  Instacart, which now operates in 16 cities and has 7,000 contract workers, plans to roll out the option to other cities in the coming months.

{"text": "The Batmobile used in the 1960s Batman TV series sold for $4.6 million at a collector car auction Saturday. The car had been the sole property of its creator, legendary car customizer George Barris. It was sold at collector car auction company Barrett Jackson's annual auction near the company's Scottsdale, Ariz., headquarters. The final price includes a 10% sales commission.  There had been some question as to whether the car would fetch a large sum. Craig Jackson, chief executive of the auction firm, said he expected the car to sell for millions.  Others pointed out, though, that many imitation Batmobiles had been built over the years, a good number of them virtually indistinguishable from the original. That raised the question of whether collectors would be willing to pay a huge sum for this Batmobile simply because it was the first.  Check out cool cars from Detroit auto show  Rick Champagne, who owns a logistics company in Tempe, Ariz., was very willing. He identified himself as the buyer in an interview with Speed TV immediately after the sale, and his name was confirmed by a representative for Barrett-Jackson.  He told Speed that the car would go in his living room. CNNMoney was not immediately able to reach Champagne for comment.  \"The energy in that room was just electric. We haven't experienced anything like that since the Futurliner,\" Jackson said, referring to the 2006 auction of a General Motors concept bus that sold for $4 million.  Bidders were so tightly packed around the Batmobile that it was hard at times to tell who was bidding, he added.  Some particularly iconic TV and movie cars have gone for very high prices. For example, a highly modified 1964 Aston Martin DB5 used in James Bond films sold for $4.6 million in 2010.  But Hollywood cars don't always command top dollar. For one thing, there are usually multiple versions created for different types of shots and for promotional use, making it hard to to say that one vehicle is definitively \"the car.\"  In this case, the TV Batmobile really is a singular creation. While there have been many imitations, this is the only original.  The Batmobile started life as a Ford (F) 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car, which was itself based on a Lincoln Mark II. Aside from its pearl white paint job, the Futura actually looked very much like the Batmobile it would become a decade later.  Related story: Shah of Iran's Plymouth XNR sells for $935,000  Famed car customizer George Barris -- also known for creating the Munster Koach and the Beverly Hillbillies' car -- was tasked with creating the Batmobile in 1966. With a tight deadline, he decided that modifying the Futura, rather than starting from scratch, was the way to go.  On television, the Batmobile's technology allowed it to shoot flames, squirt oil and shoot tire slashers, but the car is not actually designed to do any of that.  In an interview with CNNMoney in November, Barris said he had been offered large sums for the car in the past but had never considered selling before. He agreed to sell this time, he said, because he thought it was time to move the car out of his studio and put it someplace where more people could enjoy it.

{"text": "The Chinese market -- half a world away and with a completely different culture -- intimidates many small businesses. And the fears aren't unfounded. It can cost upwards of $100,000 and take more than a year to get products into China.  \"For small businesses, there's a lot of fear of exporting, period,\" said Brad McDearman, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"Only 4% of small firms with employees are actively exporting, and most only to one country.\"  Limited financial resources, fear of products being copied and lack of knowledge about international markets can hold businesses back, said McDearman.  To help ease this transition, Deborah Weidenhamer founded iPai, a Shanghai-based auction company that helps international firms introduce their products to Chinese consumers.  Related: Made in America. Sold in China  Launched in 2012, iPai charges businesses $10,000 to $15,000 (as well as a 35% commission on each sale) and sells their products at live auctions at its Shanghai showroom, at local Chinese malls and online. The company also helps with logistics for subsequent sales: importing, registering trademarks and marketing.  \"Our service lets small businesses test the Chinese market and understand consumer tastes before they make the big investment to enter China,\" said Weidenhamer, who's no stranger to the auction business. She founded Phoenix-based Auction Systems Auctioneers & Appraisers in 1995.  In 2013, iPai organized more than 100 auctions and introduced Chinese consumers to thousands of American products like California craft beer, deep fryers, cigars and nutritional supplements.  Products usually start at $80 but can be auctioned for as much as $23,000, Weidenhamer said. Watches and handbags have been particularly popular.  \"Businesses need to know that if they have a good quality product, Chinese consumers are willing to pay for it,\" said Weidenhamer. \"You could end up selling at a better price and higher quantities than in the U.S.\"  IPai has a sales force that looks for interesting small businesses to take on as clients, she said. It also has a review team that heavily screens the products and rejects those that don't meet their standards.  Because of this, she said products almost always resonate at auction. Less than 10% go unsold, in which case they're featured at another auction or returned to the consignor and iPai doesn't get paid.  Although iPai typically works with companies, it occasionally accepts independent entrepreneurs and inventors who want to discover if a product is right for China, said Weidenhamer.  That's what happened with Sazerac's Fireball Cinnamon Whisky. Produced in Louisiana, the liquor is well-known to U.S. consumers but hasn't had a presence in China.  \"Fireball's logo is a red and gold dragon. It's as if the product is perfect for China,\" said JP Neal, the brand manager for Fireball Whisky's Chinese distributor.   The challenge, however, was that cinnamon isn't a widely-used flavor in Chinese cuisine. So Neal, a consultant looking to bring popular American products into China, wanted to better understand how Chinese consumers would react to the liquor.  Neal independently hired iPai for $10,000 to help him test the market. Last fall, iPai auctioned off a case of the whisky. Some of the bottles sold for as high as $300 (in the States, a bottle goes for around $30). Neal also used the auction to poll attendees about the brand's packaging, taste and how they would drink it.  \"I got exactly the type of feedback I wanted,\" said Neal. He then approached Sazerac and convinced the company to introduce the brand to China (which landed him his current job).  Neal said a container of 420 cases of Fireball (over 5,000 bottles) is set to arrive in China in April, and it's already presold. A second container of 900 cases will ship in June.  Related: Want to boost your sales? Start exporting  In the U.S., there's been a growing push to increase small business exports, as just about 300,000 small businesses currently take advantage of other markets. The government hopes to boost this by 50,000 by 2017.  Weidenhamer is poised to take advantage of that growth.  Currently, just 5% of iPai's clients are U.S.-based, but she significantly increase that number. And as business ramps up, she also hopes to expands iPai's services to other Chinese cities.  Brookings' McDearman said iPai's efforts could be promising.   \"We are starting to see more private-sector initiatives like this come up to spur exports,\" he said. \"It's happening because there aren't enough public-sector services available to provide resources and assistance here or on the ground in China.\" ", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/03/smallbusiness/china-ipai/index.html", "author": "Parija Kavilanz", "date": "NA"},

{"text": "Jacksonville, Fla., is attempting an image change. It's hoping to swap its reputation as a stodgy old Southern city with that of an emerging hub for startups. \"Jacksonville's a hidden jewel for entrepreneurs,\" said Theodore Carter, executive director of the city's Office of Economic Development. \"We have a young ecosystem here that's very welcoming to innovation and new business.\"  In the last six years, hundreds of early-stage businesses have sprouted In Jacksonville or have relocated from other states. The city's inexpensive business and labor costs and low taxes -- not to mention warm weather and availability of capital -- are drawing entrepreneurs away from hubs like Silicon Valley and New York.  \"VC and angel money is coming back to Jacksonville,\" said Jeanne Miller, executive director of Jacksonville Civic Council. \"And the city also has a growing population of high net worth retirees looking to invest in innovative companies.\"  She said much of the city's nascent startup activity, largely in tech, health care, and consumer products, is driven by these private-sector efforts.  \"The startup culture is just starting to crystallize,\" said Darren Bounds, who's launched three tech startups in Jacksonville in the last six years. The first lacked traction and shut down; the second received $1.5 million from HR firm Adecco, which took it in house last year.  Bounds' third startup, SportsYapper.com, raised $10 million last spring and launched in September. The app helps sports fans stay connected with friends while watching a game and already has 150,000 users, although it's not yet making money.  \"In the Valley, you're constantly competing for talent and money with superstars like Google (GOOG) and Twitter (TWTR). You can't stand out,\" Bounds said. \"In Jacksonville, you can be a big fish in a small pond.\"  Related: Wal-Mart's backyard is a hotbed for startups  Carter said the city's relatively young population -- the median age has held steady at 34.5 years for the last decade -- also fuels the startup mentality. \"Young people want to control their own destiny. They're increasingly starting their own businesses here.\"  Elton Rivas is another entrepreneur contributing to Jacksonville's transformation.  Rivas left his corporate job four years ago to start a clean tech company. While it wasn't successful, it inspired him to co-found CoWork Jax (an incubator that housed SportsYapper.com in its early stages) and KYN, an accelerator that mentors more mature startups.  In 2012, he also co-launched One Spark, an annual crowdfunding festival to help match startups with money and resources in the area. In 2013, the five-day event drew 130,000 attendees, 20% who came from outside Florida.  \"We already have 700 registered startup projects for this year and about $3.5 million in capital committed from VC firms,\" he said. Rivas said the success of One Spark is a testament to the changing perception of Jacksonville.  Related: Made in America. Sold In China  Carter said the city is stepping up its efforts to court entrepreneurs. The city offers training grants, revenue grants and real estate tax abatements.  \"We have seven major universities in the area,\" said Carter. \"We're also trying to incentivize these schools to collaborate with business incubators in the downtown area.\"  But Jacksonville is the largest city by area in the continental United States, which Bounds said poses a unique challenge.  \"We have pockets of entrepreneurial activity here that are very disconnected because of distance,\" he said.  The city is trying to address this by revitalizing the downtown area and developing more incubators where entrepreneurs can collaborate.

{"text": "This is not a fake news story. Facebook's stock is actually red hot lately. Shares of the social network have rebounded sharply in the past few days after a post-Election Day pummeling.  Concerns about how Donald Trump would treat tech companies and allegations that fake stories on Facebook (FB, Tech30) helped Trump beat Hillary Clinton weighed on the stock. Shares fell nearly 10% between November 8 and November 14.  But since then, Facebook's stock has bounced back by about 7%.  So what happened?  Many big tech stocks initially tanked after Trump was elected to be the next president due to fears he would be an enemy of Silicon Valley. Trump feuded with leaders in the tech sector, most notably Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) CEO Jeff Bezos, on Twitter throughout the campaign.  Some tech executives even suggested after Trump won that California should secede from the United States. (Good luck with that.)  Making matters worse for Facebook, were the problems it faced with its news feed algorithm.  A few Clinton supporters accused Facebook of helping Trump win the election because of a preponderance of false news reports popping up on the site -- many of which were extremely negative about Clinton.  For example, First Lady Michelle Obama did NOT delete tweets about Clinton. But stories suggesting she had somehow made it to Facebook.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg initially refused to even consider that Facebook could have influenced voters. But in a surprising turn, the company announced just a few days ago that it was making tweaks in order to fight the scourge of fake news.  Related: Zuckerberg says Facebook will develop tools to fight fake news  That change of heart probably helped Facebook's stock a bit. Advertisers can't like the fact that Facebook's feed might be able to be gamed. Facebook has to seriously address fake news.  Another factor behind the stock's fall and subsequent comeback? The company admitted that there have been errors with some of its internal metrics.  That could be a significant problem if it leads marketers to try and negotiate lower ad rates or, worse, ditch the platform altogether. But that seems unlikely.  With Facebook's monthly user base approaching 2 billion, advertisers may have to put up with the company's auditing issues. There simply aren't many other platforms that offer marketers this much scope and reach.  What's more, it seems Facebook is doing the right thing for its customers and is admitting candidly that there are issues that it still needs to work on. Investors probably like that as well.  There a couple of other factors that can explain Facebook's comeback.  The company's Instagram subsidiary is continuing to roll out new features that could make it more competitive with Snapchat. (Although a cynic would argue that Instagram is simply copying Snapchat.)  Facebook also just announced a $6 billion stock buyback program.  Now on the one hand, that might be a sign that Facebook is maturing and has nothing better to do with its cash. Other \"older\" tech companies like Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) and even Google parent Alphabet  (GOOGL, Tech30)have bought back stock recently.  But Wall Street tends to cheer buybacks for two reasons. First, it's a sign that a company feels its own stock is worth investing in. And second, buying back stock reduces the number of shares outstanding -- which, in turn, boosts earnings per share.  Finally, tech stocks in general have rebounded in the past week. The Nasdaq is now at an all-time high. Trump is probably not going to wage war with Silicon Valley after all and the Golden State is not going to become the Golden Nation State.  Facebook investors probably don't have that much to worry about. Shares are still up more than 15% this year. The company is now worth $350 billion. And sales continue to grow at an impressive clip thanks to its core platform, Instagram and WhatsApp.  So Facebook should be fine for the next four years.  If nothing else, its nearly 2 billion users are going to have a lot to talk about and share thanks to Trump being in the White House. And hey. Maybe most of that content won't turn out to be fictitious either. ", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/22/investing/facebook-stock-comeback-fake-news/index.html", "author": "Paul R.

The new planes aren't expected to be ready to fly until 2022. The Air Force has already spent about $93 million preparing to build the new jets.  The Air Force has yet to place a formal order for the planes. It has chosen the latest version of Boeing's jumbo jet, the 747-8, as the platform for the new Air Force One planes. Building the basic planes would take about two years. Then modifications to protect the aircraft from attack, install VIP accommodations and allow it to be refueled mid-flight would delay the delivery two more years.  Boeing builds the 747 at its factories in Washington state, and it currently has a large back order for its commercial jets, especially the 787 Dreamliner. And airlines regularly cancel orders for planes, although it would be a loss of both prestige and revenue should the Air Force drop plans to build two new Air Force Ones.   The 747-8 has a longer range, can travel faster with a heavier maximum takeoff weight and it gets better fuel economy than the 747-200 that's used for the current Air Force Ones.

{"text": "It's one of President-elect Donald Trump's favorite punching bags and it just got bigger: America's trade deficit. The U.S. trade deficit grew at the fastest pace in 19 months, rising a sharp 18% in October from September to $42.6 billion. The increase came from higher imported goods while exports of services were flat.  Trump has often lambasted the U.S. trade deficit as a \"they win, we lose\" proposition, casting it as a weakness of the U.S. economy, costing American jobs.  \"Our trade deficit...is like having a business that continues to lose money every single year,\" Trump said earlier this year.  Trump's criticism of the trade deficit is a major reason why he wants to renegotiate trade deals and slap tariffs on Mexico and China.  Related: Unemployment drops to 4.6%, lowest since 2007  But trade experts say it's wrong to compare America's trade deficit with that of a business.  \"A nation's trade balance is nothing like a firm's bottom line,\" Douglas Irwin, a trade expert at Dartmouth, wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine. \"A country, particularly one such as the United States...can run a trade deficit indefinitely without compromising its well-being.\"  The new numbers illustrate that America is an economy that imports lots of goods, like cars, and exports lots of services, like banking.  So far this year, America has had a goods deficit of $614 billion, meaning it's importing more goods than it's exporting. Part of the reason why it's down is that U.S. manufacturers don't export more than the country imports.  Related: 3 ways Trump can slap tariffs on China and Mexico   So far this year, America has shipped in more cars, industrial supplies and building equipment than it has shipped out. That makes sense because Americans buy more stuff than they produce and sell abroad. American consumers make up the majority of economic activity.  It's the reverse on services like tech and insurance. America has a services surplus of $205 million so far this year.  Overall, the U.S. trade deficit this year is $408 billion, and it's up 2.1% from a year ago.  There's no correlation between a country's trade deficit and a weak economy. America has had a trade deficit every year except one since 1981. Australia has had a trade deficit for decades and its economy hasn't faced a recession for 25 years. Yet Japan has a trade surplus and its economy is stagnant.  While many people are praising Trump's plans for more infrastructure spending, his portrayal of the U.S. economy may be too dire, some say.  \"The economy continues to motor along and probably does not need as much help as the President-elect and angry Heartland voters say it needs,\" says Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.

In a world where a Tesla SUV can quietly blast to highway speeds in about three seconds it might be easy to forget that 4.3 seconds is still really fast. In the Shelby GT350, it definitely feels it.  Those Ford (F) engineers weren't spending all their time under the hood, either. This Mustang handles a curve better than any I can remember. Considering its overall practicality, which includes usable back seats and a fairly capacious trunk, even an ordinary Mustang offers a really good driving experience. It's balanced, gives you decent sensory feedback and is good fun to drive around on curvy roads.  Driving Shelby's new Daytona coupe  The GT350 just takes this up a notch or two. In Sport mode, with the suspension stiffened up, this car lives for tightly twisted roads. Even with all the engineering that's gone into making the GT350 light and well balanced it still feels fairly hefty, so I'm not going to say it's the best sports car I've ever driven, but this is the first Mustang I can recall that had me looking for a \"sharp curves\" warning signs. With its unique combination of agility and brute aggression, it is definitely among my favorites.  Also impressive was the fact that, in regular traffic, it felt little different from a your ordinary Mustang. Well, except for the fact that the GT350 is available only with a manual transmission. (That shifter, by the say, is a joy to use.)  While it's a compelling value compared to cars offering similar performance, the $55,000 starting price could put this pony car out of reach for a lot of ordinary folks. Fortunately, the Mustang comes in more variations than just about anything besides Coca-Cola. Even at this price, the GT350 is unquestionably my favorite flavor.

{"text": "President-elect Donald Trump will soon unveil a group made up of leading minds in business to provide their insights and opinions about jobs and the economy. The all-star team of corporate execs will be led by billionaire Blackstone founder Stephen Schwarzman, according to a document provided to CNNMoney by Blackstone.  The group, dubbed the Strategic and Policy Forum, also includes JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, longtime Walt Disney (DIS) boss Bob Iger and former GE leader Jack Welch.  Dimon had been floated as a possible treasury secretary, but Trump ultimately selected former Goldman Sachs  (GS)banker Steve Mnuchin.  Two of the 16 members are women: General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra and Ginni Rometty, the head of IBM (IBM, Tech30).  The group will have a direct line to Trump and be tasked with giving the president-elect nonpartisan views on how government policy impacts the economy and jobs. The forum is expected to hold its first meeting during the first week of February at the White House.  Related: Trump: Companies to be punished for leaving U.S.  The news comes at a pivotal time for Trump's relationship with Corporate America.  Earlier this week, Trump reached a deal with Carrier that will keep jobs from leaving the U.S. in exchange for incentives. The president-elect threatened to punish other companies that try to move jobs overseas.   \"Companies are not going to leave the U.S. anymore without consequences,\" Trump said Thursday at the Indiana plant where the company makes furnaces.  But critics, including conservatives like the Wall Street Journal editorial page and liberal icon Bernie Sanders, warned the Carrier deal sets a bad precedent.  Trump's group also includes BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink, WalMart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon, former Boeing (BA) CEO Jim McNerney, Ernst & Young boss Mark Weinberger and Boston Consulting Group Rich Lesser.  There are also several members with government experience, including former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins and ex-Federal Reserve official Kevin Warsh.  Also in the group: Toby Cosgrove, CEO of Cleveland Clinic; Adebayo \"Bayo\" Ogunlesi, chairman of Global Infrastructure Partners; and Daniel Yergin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning vice chairman of IHS Markit.  President Obama similarly put together a jobs council in 2009 during the Great Recession that provided advice on restoring the U.S. to economic growth.  Trump is poised to take office during decidedly better economic times. New numbers released on Friday show the U.S. unemployment rate dropped to a nine-year low of 4.6% in November.

{"text": "There are plenty of electric cars on the market right now. But none of them stand out quite like the new UK1909 vehicle from Morgan Motor.  The kooky three-wheeled vehicle is the niche British automaker's first foray into the electric-powered market after 107 years of business. The car is reminiscent of the company's first model, another three-wheeler that debuted in 1909.  The focus of this car is fun and excitement, and not Tesla-style practicality.  CNNMoney got exclusive access to drive and film the new car near the company's headquarters in Malvern, which is an hour's drive west from William Shakespeare's birthplace, Stratford-upon-Avon.  The topless sports car is remarkably loud for an electric vehicle and produces a satisfying \"vroom\" that's sure to thrill attention-seeking drivers. (Bystanders were suitably agog during CNNMoney's test drive.)  The UK1909 is not the most powerful car, with just 70 horsepower. And its range (150 miles per charge) is limited by its smaller frame and battery storage capacity.  Morgan cars, which look like they could have been plying England's roads during World War I, are built largely without the assembly line methods and machinery seen at most modern automakers.   The small, family-owned automaker is only producing 19 UK1909s and selling them exclusively at the London department store Selfridges. The price -- \u00a352,500 ($65,300) -- isn't far off what a Tesla Model S goes for in the U.K.  Despite the limited production run, Morgan insists that electric cars will be a key part of its future.  Morgan is investing \u00a36 million ($7.5 million) in electric technology and plans to eventually produce larger four-wheel electric models.   It will also use the UK1909 frame -- with different trim and colors -- to make a second electric car, the EV3. Morgan plans to sell 50 EV3s per year, a significant commitment for a company that produces only 850 hand-built cars a year.  \"We won't necessarily make a large return on selling [UK1909 and] EV3 vehicles. But in doing this campaign we are exploring what it means to produce these cars,\" said Morgan's head of design, Jonathan Wells.  \"It's a nice way of us gathering momentum as we explore [electric technology] much more significantly further down the line,\" he said.   Selfridges, which collaborated on the UK1909 design, is promoting the car's launch by selling a variety of driving accessories to the 19 buyers, including goggles and a scarf crafted by British luxury brand Alexander McQueen.   Morgan is also selling a kids version of the UK1909, which is on display at Selfridges. It's priced as \u00a37,300 ($9,100).

{"text": "Tiffany, the iconic jewelry retailer, said on Tuesday that sales in the U.S. were hurt by all the chaos surrounding its flagship store on New York City's 5th Avenue, which just so happens to be neighbors with Trump Tower. While Tiffany didn't mention the President-elect by name, it was clear what Tiffany was referring to when it said that there has been \"some adverse effect on traffic\" at the 5th Avenue location due to \"the impact of recent election-related activity.\"  Tiffany added that there was \"softness\" at this store and warned that sales could be hit again in the fourth quarter. The 5th Avenue store accounts for close to 10% of the company's total sales.  Overall sales for Tiffany's U.S. and other North American stores in its most recent quarter fell 2% from a year ago.  Security has been heightened on 5th Avenue since the election. There have been some protests outside Trump Tower. But much of the police activity is due to the fact that Donald Trump lives in Trump Tower and has been holed up there since the election.  Tiffany CFO Mark Erceg added during a conference call that there were \"minor disruptions to pedestrian foot traffic\" around the 5th Avenue store and that Tiffany was \"understandably cautious as to how the situation might impact sales over the coming weeks.\"  But it's not all bad news for Tiffany. Sales in China and Japan were strong, helping to lead to a slight increase in overall revenue for the company. It's the first time Tiffany's quarterly sales rose since November 2014.  Related: Protecting Donald Trump costs NYC more than $1 million a day  Tiffany CEO Frederic Cumenal said in a press release that the company was \"encouraged by some early signs of improvement in sales trends.\"  Investors chose to focus on that instead of the weakness in the Big Apple. Shares of Tiffany (TIF) rose 5% in early trading on the news.  Like most retailers, the holidays tend to be a busy time for Tiffany. And the company reaffirmed its outlook for the fourth quarter, a sign that it does not expect any further weakness at its flagship store to drag down results for the whole company.  Nonetheless, it's a tumultuous time in the jewelry business -- putting aside all the election-related madness. Tiffany's competitor Signet (SIG), which owns discount jewelry brands Kay, Jared and Zales, has been accused of selling fake diamonds.  And online jeweler Blue Nile (NILE) is in the process of being taken private by a group led by Bain Capital.  Bain is the private equity firm co-founded by Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who is rumored to be a contender for Secretary of State in Trump's administration.

{"text": "John Gutz walked into a Sam's Club one day to buy $10,000 in gift cards. He planned to bring them home and read the card numbers over the phone to a man who claimed he'd accidentally transferred $10,000 into Gutz's bank account. The man pleaded with Gutz to return the money as quickly as possible, and suggested the gift card scheme as an easy solution.  The 83-year-old Gutz was convinced the man's job was in jeopardy and wanted to help. He even raised his credit limit to buy the cards and return the money quickly.  Luckily his daughter, Julia Gutz Moller, called to check in that day before he handed over the card information.  \"I said, 'Dad, this is a scam.' And he said 'No, Julia, it's not. I have to help this man,'\" she told CNNMoney.  That wasn't the only time Gutz had been targeted. Scammers first started calling him shortly after his wife died. At first, they claimed his computer had a virus and they would fix it for $500. They were persistent. Sometimes the phone would ring multiple times in one hour, and Gutz finally cracked under the pressure.  \"They knew Mom died and they really laid into it, telling Dad that he wouldn't want to lose access to emails, photos and memories or be a burden to his family,\" Julia said.  He handed over his credit card number, and a link he clicked on in an email sent by the fraudsters gave them access to his computer.  Related: The victims of a $200 million psychic scam  Financial scams aren't new. But as the Baby Boomer generation gets older, more retirees are becoming targets.  \"Elder financial abuse is becoming more commonplace, and unfortunately, it also appears to be greater than we thought in both scope and impact,\" said Walter White, the President and CEO of Allianz Life.  About 37% of people surveyed recently by the insurance company said the senior they cared for had lost money because of financial abuse. They lost $36,000 on average.  Even if the incidence rate stays the same, we'll see more seniors scammed as the over-65 population continues to grow, White said.  Eventually, they fraudsters agreed to refund Gutz the $500 for the computer virus scam-- but they asked for his bank account number in order to transfer him the money. They then used that to get an advance from his credit card and make the \"accidental\" transfer of $10,000 into his account.  Julia convinced her father that this, too, was a scam. He was able to return the cards, but is still working on clearing the charges associated with the credit card advance. He tossed the computer the fraudsters had access to and bought a new one.  \"He's a smart man, and he knew how these kinds of scams worked. But the fraudsters wore him down and preyed on his fear of losing independence,\" Julia said.  It's not just about losing money. These scams are time-consuming and stressful for the seniors they target. Gutz was hounded by phone calls and emails over the course of two years. At one point, he and his daughter were on the phone with his bank for four hours. Straightening everything out required in-person visits to the branch, paperwork, and updating account information and passwords.  They notified the local police and FBI, but no one was ever caught. It's often difficult to track down the perpetrators of telemarketing scams. In this case, the fraudsters called Gutz from different phone numbers from all over the country.  Julia is determined to help other people learn from their experience and volunteers her time with Allianz's Safeguarding Our Seniors program. They train employee volunteers to go out into senior communities to raise awareness about financial scams.  Related: Wells Fargo illegally repossessed 413 service members' cars  It's not uncommon for a fraudster to offer computer help, like they did with Gutz, as well as home repairs or yard work. Other typical scams claim you've won the lottery or sweepstakes, ask for a donation to a charity, and present too-good-to-be-true investment schemes. CNNMoney uncovered the psychic at the center of a massive mail scam that ran for decades across several continents.  Julia's biggest piece of advice is to prepare for an incident like this before it happens, and even suggests running a \"fire drill.\" That way you'll know what user names, passwords and other security information you'll need and who to call in case your bank account is hacked or credit card number falls into the wrong hands.  What set Julia back during the incident was that she didn't have access to all of her father's accounts. That meant that the bank wouldn't help her over the phone and that they both had to show up in person.  Related: IRS impersonators accused of stealing millions from the elderly  While scams from strangers are scary and prevalent, about half of elder financial abuse might be perpetuated by family members or close friends, according to Allianz. These types of incidents go under-reported, and are complicated. But it might be helpful for seniors to have more than just one person in their \"trusted circle,\" who they can talk to about their financial situation, White said.  If you think you or someone you care for has been a victim of financial abuse, contact the Adult Protective Services Association to report the incident.

{"text": "Competition in the credit card industry has never been higher, and as a result, there has never been a better time to get a new credit card than right now. Introductory bonuses, reward rates, and no-interest introductory periods are all more generous than ever, and the industry average for annual fees continues to decline.  When lenders compete, consumers win  In recent years, competition among credit card issuers has heated up -- especially for consumers with great credit. It makes sense, as credit card debt comes with relatively high interest rates. Borrowers with excellent credit pay an average interest rate of more than 13% on credit card purchases, even though this group has little risk of defaulting.  To attract lucrative customers, credit card issuers have been consistently trying to one-up each other when it comes to introductory bonuses, 0% APR periods, and the rate at which cards earn rewards. Not long ago, a 21-month 0% APR period or a 2% reward rate on all purchases was unheard-of; now it's readily available.  According to WalletHub's credit card landscape report, here are some of the consumer-friendly trends in the credit card industry.  The value of initial rewards bonuses hit a record high during the third quarter, with an average of $101.48 in cash or 15,664 points/miles. New applicants can now get 313% more cash or 123% more points/miles than they could in 2010.  The average 0% APR introductory period for new purchases is 9.8 months, up 2.3% from a year ago.  The average cash-back rewards rate has risen 2% from last year, and the average initial bonus has grown by 2.3%.  For points/miles cards, the average initial bonus is up by 9.4% over the past year.  The average annual fee has fallen for five straight quarters, down 5.85% over the past year.  Foreign transaction fees have been falling and are now 20% lower than at the beginning of 2011.  One downside is that interest rates have been increasing slightly. Credit cards typically have variable interest rates, and given the widespread anticipation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December, it appears that credit card companies are adjusting their rates upward to compensate.  But I'm not saying this is the best time to carry a credit card balance. Rather, now is an excellent time to take advantage of lucrative introductory bonuses and 0% APR offers. If you can do that without paying the credit card issuers a dime in interest, then you'll be a big winner.  Examples of great credit card offers  Just to name a few, here are some of the best credit card offers on the market right now.  For a big introductory bonus, the recently introduced Chase Sapphire Reserve has been a game-changer. The card does have a hefty $450 annual fee, but it offers a 100,000-point introductory bonus after $4,000 in purchases within three months. That's worth $1,500 when redeemed for travel. The card also has a $300 annual credit for travel purchases and earns triple points on travel and dining expenses.  If the Reserve is too rich for your blood, then the Chase Sapphire Preferred has a $95 annual fee and a bonus worth $625 on travel.  If you're looking to transfer a balance or make a new purchase without paying interest, the Citi Simplicity card has an industry-leading 21-month 0% APR introductory period on purchases and balance transfers, as well as no annual fee. The Chase Slate has a shorter 15-month 0% APR period, but it charges no balance-transfer fees for the first 60 days -- a unique perk in the credit card industry.  Finally, for a great reward rate, the Capital One Venture card earns a 2% reward rate on all purchases and has a relatively low $59 annual fee. In addition, the card offers a 40,000-mile bonus if you make $3,000 in purchases within three months.  These are just a few of the offers available right now, and many other cards come with benefits that might make more sense for you, so shop around.

However, if you have some holiday shopping or traveling to do that you were planning to pay for in full anyway, or if you were considering applying for a new credit card for your day-to-day expenses, then now is an excellent time to capitalize on the fierce competition among credit card issuers.

{"text": "Climbing into the cockpit of Shelby American's 50th Anniversary Daytona Coupe is very much like going back in time. Only it's a bit more comfortable. The steering wheel has a fat leather rim, metal spokes and a metal badge at its center. The dashboard looks like a '60s-era science project with plainly labeled knobs and switches set into a flat black surface. The only clues that this is a modern vehicle and not a 1965 race car are the switches for the air conditioning and power windows. Then there's price tag.  This car costs about $230,000 with a fiberglass body. With an aluminum body it would cost about $100,000 more. Either way, it's a tiny sliver of the cost of the original car of the original Shelby Daytona Coupe it's based on.  There were only six made back in the mid-1960s. Today, one of those cars is worth about $25 million, according the the Hagerty Price Guide for Collectible Cars.  They were built to win some of the most fiercely competitive races in Europe and America. In those days, Shelby had already been winning races with the well-known Shelby Cobra, a powerful open-topped car. But the Cobra had a major weak point: aerodynamics. With its muscular engine and lightweight body, the Cobra was quick, but on tracks with long straightaways -- where top speed was everything -- the fat-nosed Cobra fell behind.  Shelby engineers created a new body with a chisel-shaped nose that split the air, a smooth roof rather than open cockpit and a concave back that spun air into a controlled swirl behind the car as it passed. The result was an astonishing increase in top speed.  The original Shelby Cobra couldn't reach 160 miles per hour, but early versions of the Daytona Coupe could go over 190. There were other improvements made to the car, as well. In all, it was enough for Shelby to win the World Sportscar Championship, beating Carroll Shelby's hated rival, Ferrari.  Related - Driving the Shelby Cobra in Vegas  Shelby's 50th Anniversary version of the Daytona isn't intended to be a pure recreation of the racecar. Instead, it's meant as a car someone could comfortably drive on a more-or-less regular basis. For one thing, it's roomier than the tight-fitting racecars were. Only 50 will be made.  Clearly, the person who buys a Shelby Daytona Coupe isn't just looking for nice sports car. The same money can buy a Porsche 911 Turbo S, for example. That car provides even better performance is much safer, simpler to drive and even more comfortable.  But the 911 Turbo S lacks one major feature. It's not a Shelby Daytona Coupe. It doesn't look like you just drove off the track at LeMans in 1965. The Porsche is a great car but the Shelby radiates coolness in a way few other cars do. And it's a fun car precisely because it doesn't drive like a modern button-downed sports car. The steering wheel feels a craftsman's tool in the hand and the shifter, angled oddly forward from the transmission tunnel, flips nicely from gear to gear. But. with its long hood, big engine up front and power going to the rear wheels only, it feels as classic as it looks.  The Daytona's big aluminum V8 engine sounded amazing, of course, with a rumble that reverberated in the chest. (The engine is ordered separately from the rest of the car so there are lots of available choices.) In turns, the Daytona felt easy and balanced. Yes, there was no sunroof, Bluetooth or computer screen with turn-by-turn navigation but still, when we got done shooting the video, I made excuses to keep driving a little longer.

{"text": "When a watch costs $40,000, you don't want to end up with buyer's remorse. Enter Eleven James, a company that offers men the chance to try out a new watch for a few months at a time, by allowing its members to rent different luxury watches several times a year.  Like NetJets, which lets customers buy \u00e0 la carte flights on private planes, Rent the Runway for pricey party dresses and Bag Borrow or Steal for high-end handbags, Eleven James gives customers access to luxury watches they may not be able to afford or may just want to test out without the five-figure price tag and lifetime commitment.  Users make two primary choices: what type of watches they want to wear and how frequently they want to change. There are currently three tiers, based on watches that retail for $10,000, $20,000 and $40,000. They then choose how many times they want to switch it up -- between three and six times per year. They fill out a preference sheet based on brands and styles they're interested in, and work with a concierge to figure out which watches they'll try next.  Membership for the least expensive watches, brands like Breitling, Panerai and Rolex, start at $199 per month, or $2,150 per year. On the high end, for watches like Patek Philippe and A. Lange & Sohne, it can reach $1,379 per month, or $14,900 per year.  Related: 13 things to know about the Apple Watch  In an age when a clock is displayed on any of the expensive electronic devices people already carry, why would anyone pay to borrow a device that only tells time?  According to Randy Brandoff, Eleven James' founder and CEO, the watch is still what makes an outfit, and there's a tremendous amount of heritage and craftsmanship that many people, especially in the professional sphere, still appreciate.  But because it's such a huge purchase, and a person can only wear one at a time, the idea of getting to try out a number of different watches without first having to buy one is appealing, he said.  Santo Rosabianca is one customer who'd grown tired of his old Omega. But after signing up with Eleven James, he suddenly had new options that suited his tastes -- a Chopard Grand Prix de Monaco to fit his Formula 1 fandom, and an Italian-made Panerai to appeal to his Italian heritage.  \"Everyone I meet compliments me and it's brought me new business. It's a real conversation starter,\" he said. \"I've been really blessed by it.\"  Of course, it appeals to collectors who are intrigued by the idea of trying out all kinds of watches and models several times a year. But it's also bringing in a new customer.  \"We're seeing millennials who, as adults, are getting ever more curious,\" he said. \"It's a pretty big leap to go from an iPhone to a Rolex, so they want to try them out.\"  That's good news for the watch industry, since Brandoff said the company is attracting clients who weren't yet collecting or had become apathetic because they didn't have any variety. It makes sense, then, that 85% of its members said they were more likely to purchase a watch within the next year because of the service.  Brent Handler was one of them. He ended up purchasing the first watch he was sent to try from Eleven James.

The deal has widely been seen as a victory for Trump -- he mostly delivered on a campaign promise. But Sanders argues that Carrier and its parent company, United Technologies (UTX), are having the last laugh.  \"In essence, United Technologies (parent of Carrier) took Trump hostage and won. And that should send a shock wave of fear through all workers across the country,\" Sanders said in an Op-Ed in The Washington Post on Thursday.  Sanders key point: If corporations want cushy tax cuts, all you have to do is threaten Trump and say \"we're moving to Mexico.\"  \"He has signaled to every corporation in America that they can threaten to offshore jobs in exchange for business-friendly tax benefits and incentives,\" Sanders wrote.  On Tuesday, Trump and Carrier announced that they had reached an agreement to keep over 1,000 jobs in Indiana that had been slated to be moved to Mexico.  Related: Carrier: Trump gave us \"incentives\" to save jobs  Carrier said it received \"incentives\" from Indiana, where Vice President-elect Mike Pence is still governor, but declined to specify exactly what sweetened the deal.  Sanders, who campaigned to fight corporate greed, criticized Trump for putting on \"kid gloves\" with Carrier and offer it tax incentives to stay -- a tactic lots of states and cities do.  Sanders points out that wasn't what Trump told voters.  \"After running a campaign pledging to be tough on corporate America, Trump has hypocritically decided to do the exact opposite,\" Sanders wrote.  On the campaign trail, Trump frequently threatened to slap Carrier with a stiff 35% tariff if it moved jobs to Mexico. But during negotiations, Carrier depicted a friendlier Trump.

He plans to soon introduce a bill to Congress to prevent jobs from being outsourced to other countries.

{"text": "Protecting President-elect Donald Trump and his family is costing New York City more than $1 million a day, according to three city officials. And those costs won't necessarily drop significantly once he moves to the White House.  That's because Melania Trump and their 10-year old son Barron expect to stay at their home at Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan, at least until the end of the school year. And Donald Trump has indicated he plans to return home regularly, especially while they're still here.  Adding to the expense is the cost of police assigned to Trump's adult children and his grandchildren, who are also receiving Secret Service protection, John Miller, NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence & counterterrorism, told WCBS Monday. All of them live in the city, and all are entitled to receive Secret Service protection.  \"The number one imperative here is safety and security. We owe that to the president elect, his family and his team,\" said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio at a press conference on Friday. But he added the city will need help with those costs, particularly police overtime.  \"This is a very substantial undertaking. It will take substantial resources,\" he said. \"We will begin the conversation with the federal government shortly on reimbursement for the NYPD for some of the costs that we are incurring.\"  While primary responsibility for the protection of the president, or president-elect, rests with the Secret Service, local law enforcement is charged with assisting them, particularly in controlling movements of the general public.  Related: Top network executives, anchors meet with Trump  Every president is required to have local law enforcement protection when they return home during their terms. But protecting Trump in New York City is particularly costly, given that he lives in the most densely-populated neighborhood of the nation's biggest city.  \"We have never had a situation where a POTUS (president of the United States) would be here on such a regular basis,\" said de Blasio. \"The details of his future plans are unknown, but we certainly know over these next 65 days [until the inauguration] he will be here regularly. The NYPD is up to the challenge and the city of New York is up to the challenge, I have no doubt about that.\"  Related: Donald Trump says SNL was 'biased' and asks for 'equal time'  The city has sought and received reimbursement for protecting world leaders in the past, such as when heads of state visit the United Nations, de Blasio said. City records show it received $26 million in reimbursements for such expenses in the 12 months ending June 30, or about $500,000 a week. But the fact that the city will need to protect Trump on an ongoing basis is unprecedented, de Blasio said.  \"This makes [previous protection efforts] look quite small obviously,\" he said. \"We'll have to establish a new set of ground rules.\"  The police have set up barricades around Trump Tower at 56th Street and 5th Avenue, smack in the middle of the city. While a block of 56th street has basically been closed to traffic, 5th Avenue remains open, although the traffic flow on that major thoroughfare has been affected.  And as Trump moves through the city, police need to close streets accordingly. For example, the Lincoln Tunnel was closed to traffic on Friday afternoon during rush hour when Trump traveled to New Jersey.

In an editorial Friday entitled \"Trump's Carrier Shakedown,\" the newspaper argues that President-elect Donald Trump's pressuring the company not to move jobs is bad for the economy, and for the workers in the long run. It said Carrier wanted to move the line to Mexico to remain competitive in the market.  \"As U.S. auto workers have learned the hard way, real job security depends on the profitability of the business,\" the paper's editorial page said. \"If the extra costs of staying in Indianapolis erode that business, those workers will lose their jobs eventually in any case.\"  The paper argues that Carrier had no choice but to give into Trump's pressure because of the threat of a 35% tariff on goods imported from Mexico, as well as the fact that parent company United Technologies (UTX) gets $5.6 billion a year, or 10% of its revenue, from defense contracts.  Related: Trump threatens that companies will be punished for leaving U.S.  \"Then there's the potential damage to the Carrier brand, especially its consumer air conditioner sales, if Mr. Trump decided to blast it from the bully -- and we mean bully -- pulpit,\" the paper wrote. \"So United Technologies decided to take the small cost against earnings.\"  The paper also cites Trump pressuring Ford Motor (F) not to shift production of a Lincoln crossover SUV to Mexico, even though that move would not have cost any U.S. jobs.

But fighting the trend of U.S. companies moving to Mexico won't be easy.  More than 250,000 jobs will be lost due to plant closing announcements this year, according to Challenger, Gray and Christmas.  Saving the Carrier jobs is \"only a drop in the bucket,\" said John Challenger, the firm's CEO.  In fact there are thousands of more jobs that will be lost from plant closings in Indiana alone in the coming months.  One plant that is still scheduled to move to Mexico is owned by United Technologies (UTX), the same parent company that owns Carrier. The electronic controls factory has 700 workers in Huntington, Indiana.  A bearing plant in Indianapolis owned by Rexnord is also planning to ship its jobs to Mexico. Union officials say about 350 jobs will be lost in that move.  \"We cannot compete with a $3 an hour wage,\" said Chuck Jones, president of the Indianapolis unit of the United Steelworkers Union, which represents the workers at both Rexnord and Carrier. \"I believe it's only going to get worse.\"  Related: China warns Trump - Good luck bringing jobs back to the U.S.  In tiny Sellersburg, Indiana, with population of about 6,000, a plant with 84 workers making food and beverage equipment is being shutdown by Manitowoc Foodservice (MFS).

The shutdown announcement came about a week after a Chinese company, Qingdao Haier Co., completed a $5.6 billion purchase of the appliance unit from GE (GE).  A railroad car supplier in Gary, Indiana, Stanrail, which had just over 100 workers, is also in the process of shutting down. A company executive said the plant's work would be shifted to the companies' plants that have excess capacity in Ontario, Canada, and Mississippi.  Related: Trump's Carrier deal draws hugely divided reactions  Most of the plant closings are not tied to work being shifted outside the United States.

{"text": "Any last questions we had about the Apple Watch were answered Monday afternoon. During an event in San Francisco, CEO Tim Cook and other executives announced key details about the Apple Watch, including when it will go on sale, where it will be available, and exactly how much it costs.  Here's what we now know about Apple's first wearable device:  1. The Apple Watch will go on sale online and by reservation in Apple stores on April 24.   Pre-orders begin April 10.   2. The Watch will be available to customers in nine markets, including the U.S. The others are Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United Kingdom.  3. The cheapest Apple Watch -- the 38mm sport model -- will cost $349, as expected. The 42mm (which is the height from top to bottom of the watch) will cost $399. The most expensive version of the Apple Watch, called the Apple Watch Edition, will start at $10,000 and cost as much as $17,000.  4. On a full charge, the Apple Watch battery should last up to 18 hours. This is critical, since the Apple Watch needs to be continuously connected to an iPhone in order to work, which can be a big battery drain.   5. The Apple Watch will be available in three models: The Apple Watch Sport, the Apple Watch and the Apple Watch Edition.   6. The watches are made from anodized aluminum (Apple Watch Sport), stainless steel (Apple Watch) and 18-karat gold (Apple Watch Edition). The Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition screens will be crafted from sapphire crystal, the same material used in luxury watches. The Apple Watch Sport will feature an Ion-X glass display.   7. There are only two buttons on the watch.   8. Each model will come in two sizes: a 38mm, or 1.5 inch (height), and 42 mm or 1.7 inch.   9. The Apple Watch needs an iPhone to connect to the Internet. And not just any iPhone -- the oldest iPhone it will connect to is the iPhone 5, and it has to be running iOS 8.2 software, which is available for download as of Monday. It connects to the iPhone via Bluetooth.   10. Each Apple Watch model will be available in two colors: Stainless steel and black stainless steel for the Apple Watch; silver aluminum and gray aluminum for the Apple Watch Sport; and 18-karat yellow gold and 18-karat rose gold for the Apple Watch Edition.   11. There are six types of wristbands: 1) a metal band with a traditional clasp 2) a rubber sport band 3) a magnetic leather band 4) a leather band with a classic buckle 5) a leather band with a modern buckle and 6) a flexible metal magnetic band.   12. You can use it to work out. The Apple Watch will have a heart rate sensor and an accelerometer to measure body movements, including step count. The watch does not have GPS, which comes as a major disappointment to fitness enthusiasts.   13. It will \"tap\" you when you have notifications. You can also tap it back, sending other Watch owners taps that can emulate a sender's heartbeat.

{"text": "If you've ever seen a Rolls-Royce with a painted pinstripe down the side -- that long, thin dead-straight line that goes from the just behind the headlights to just before the taillights -- you're seeing the artwork of Mark Court. That's his job and his alone. A former village sign painter he now paints coach stripes, as they're properly called, on Rolls-Royce cars at the company's Goodwood, England factory. His job is the last step in the manufacturing process and if he messes up that line... He just can't mess up that line. There is no eraser that will fix it. The paint has special properties that instantly bond it to the underlying car paint.  That's serious pressure, so the proper mental state is important.  \"This is just another car to me,\" he said. \"If you start worrying about who owns them or where it's going, it'll play with your mind. Then you'll never do it. You just got to be able to learn to shut off and do what you need to do.\"  He rarely takes time off because it would cause him to lose his focus.  \"Weekends are bad enough,\" he said, \"because now I have to refocus and I have come back into it again.\"  When there's time off at the factory -- when the the plant's being retooled to build a new model, for instance -- Court usually travels to various parts of the world to paint customers' cars or to display his skills in public exhibitions.  Tall and burly with a thick, rolling accent, Court looks and sounds like just the sort of man who you could imagine painting English pub signs. That's what he used to do before he came here. He applied for the the Rolls-Royce job as soon as he heard the automaker would open a factory in his rural village in 2003.  \"For me, it was just adapting a skill that I already had to a technique for doing six meters of car,\" he said.  Six meters is about 20 feet -- the length of a roughly $500,000 Rolls-Royce Phantom.  Photos - Cool cars from the Geneva Motor Show  A skill like Court's wasn't easy to find. He was flown to Germany to meet with Ian Cameron, the man BMW had hired to head up Rolls-Royce design. BMW had bought the Rolls brand a few years earlier. Cameron showed him a perfect hand-painted coach line.  \"It was a case of 'Can you do that?'\" Court recalled. \"Well, I'm a cocky Englishman. I can do anything.\"  From there, Court was sent to BMW's motorcycle factory, the only part of the company, at that time, that did hand-painted lines. He perfected his craft painting gas tanks and fairings, the shell that goes over the frame of some racing-style motorcycles.  Court uses squirrel hair brushes that he trims himself to just the right shape. He powders his fingers so they slide easily across the car's smooth painted surface as he follows a guide line made from tape. The tape doesn't mask the edge of the line, it's purely a guide from which he keeps a set distance.  His job involves much more than just straight lines, though. Customers also request a variety of custom designs including flowers, horse heads, various abstract shapes and, of course, their initials. He spent hours painting lines and flowers on Rolls-Royce's Serenity show car that was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show this year.  He's still trying to find an apprentice to someday take his place. So far two apprentices have dropped out. One was his own son, who decided to go to work in Rolls-Royce's wood shop, instead.  \"Time marches on,\" Court said. \"I ain't getting no younger.

{"text": "President-elect Donald Trump took credit Thursday night on Twitter for stopping Ford from moving jobs from Kentucky to Mexico. The only problem with the claim? Ford had never said it planned to move its Louisville, Kentucky assembly plant to Mexico.  In fact, the automaker pledged last year, in a legally binding contract with the United Auto Workers union, to invest $700 million in Louisville, where it builds the popular Ford Escape.  Forget what Trump tweeted. Here's what really happened.  On Thursday, Ford (F) said it will keep production of the Lincoln MKC at the plant. It had planned to shift production of the MKC to another plant and Mexico was a likely location.  But even if Ford had shifted production of the MKC to Mexico, it planned to keep employment in Louisville near the current level of 4,700 workers.  The MKC, a luxury version of the Escape, is not a major product for Ford. The company sold 25,000 of them in the U.S. last year, compared to 306,000 for the Escape. This year's sales will be about the same.  Still, Ford's decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was enough for the president-elect to take a victory lap on his favorite medium of Twitter on Thursday night.  \"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky -- no Mexico,\" he tweeted.  \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\"   Ford had temporarily shut its Louisville plant the weeks of October 17 and October 31 due to slowing sales and excess inventory. That was standard operating procedure in the industry -- not a plan to move production to Mexico. And most of the 4,700 workers affected continued to receive 80% of their normal play during this temporary shutdown.  Ford reiterated Thursday that it has invested $12 billion in U.S. plants and added 28,000 American jobs in the past five years. That represents nearly a 50% increase in U.S. jobs at Ford during that period.  \"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" said the statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"  Related: Ford will be the first automaker to import cars to India to the U.S.  Ford's response to Trump was far more conciliatory than some of its statements before last week's vote.  In September, when Trump wrongly claimed Ford was planning to move all production to Mexico, Ford CEO Mark Fields came out and said he was flat out wrong about company plans.  \"Absolutely not. Zero. Not one job will be lost. Most of our investment is here in the US. And that's the way it will continue to be,\" Fields said in September. \"It's really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts.\"  In October Bill Ford called Trump's criticism of the automaker founded by his great-grandfather \"infuriating.\"  Related: Ford will be the first automaker to import cars to India to the U.S.  Ford has announced plans to move small car production to a new plant under construction in Mexico. But the workers who now build those models -- the C-Max and Ford Focus -- will keep their jobs and be put to work building more profitable and popular vehicles, likely the new Ford Bronco SUV.  This is not the first time that Trump has claimed credit for getting Ford to change its mind on Mexico production when in fact Ford was only following the terms of a contract it had reached with the UAW.  A year ago when Ford started building the heavy duty F-Series trucks in Ohio rather than in Mexico, where they had been built, Trump again claimed credit.  \"I brought [Ford's Mexican investment plans] up in so many speeches, and frankly I think I embarrassed 'em,\" he told a crowd in New Hampshire in October 2015. \"But Ford is now gonna build a massive plant in the United States, and every single person, even my harshest critics gave me credit for it.\"  However Ford wasn't building a new plant, simply shifting production to an existing U.S. plant.

{"text": "Carrier is getting a modest $7 million in financial incentives over the next 10 years from the state of Indiana to keep 1,000 jobs at an Indianapolis plant, sources familiar with the deal tells CNN. That is just a fraction of the estimated $65 million a year it expected to save if it had moved those jobs to Mexico. It suggests that the incentives cited by Carrier were not the only factor in its decision to stay put.  The company will get $500,000 per year in state income tax refunds, as long as it keeps at least 1,069 manufacturing jobs in the state.  It will also get about $200,000 a year to retrain workers, funding which is generally provided by the state. Carrier actually had to return some retraining funds to the state when it announced plans to move to Mexico earlier this year, and this deal reinstates that money.  Related: The NAFTA teardown - Here's where Trump could start  Carrier announced late Tuesday that it had reached a deal with President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is currently governor of Indiana, to keep about 1,000 of 1,400 jobs at its Indianapolis plant, rather than move them to Mexico. The company said state \"incentives\" from Indiana were an \"important consideration\" to its decision to stay put.  But experts say the state incentives are more likely window dressing.  Most research indicates that economic development incentives rarely change a firm's behavior, according to Nathan Jensen, a professor at the University of Texas. \"They are a subsidy to a company with little value to society. Our research shows that offering incentives is a great way for politicians to take credit, or minimize blame, for company decisions.\"  Even though this package of incentives isn't a lot of money, the practice is worrisome from a policy perspective, Jensen said.  \"It's clearly a small deal. But you have a business that made a threat getting $7 million it doesn't need,\" Jensen said, \"while there are small businesses paying the full tax rate.\" He added that \"there's the concern that this only encourages more companies to make this kind of threat to move, if not to Mexico then to another state.\"  Carrier's statement also cited Trump's promise to \"create an improved, more competitive U.S. business climate.\"  It's not yet clear how much of the company's decision was based on concerns about maintaining the significant amount of business it does with the government.  Carrier parent United Technologies (UTX) is a major defense contractor, with $5.6 billion in revenue from federal government contracts, or 10% of its total revenue. The government also pays for $1.5 billion of its research and development costs.  \"I have no doubt that the company was thinking about more than a single plant when they made the decision,\" said Jensen.  Trump had also threatened to impose steep tariffs on goods made in Mexico that are exported back to the U.S. And he has vowed to renegotiate NAFTA, the free trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. The uncertainty about the future of NAFTA could also have made Carrier reconsider the move.  Related: 1,000 jobs saved by Trump. Thousands more to go  Whatever the reason for the change of heart, members of the Trump team were thrilled with the credit he is getting for saving the Carrier jobs.  \"The President-elect and the Vice President(-elect) picked up the phone and called the CEO of United Technologies and told them we want to keep jobs here. Can't remember the last time a president did that,\" Steven Mnuchin, Trump's pick to be Treasury secretary, told reporters in the Trump Tower lobby Wednesday.  The deal is being criticized by officials on both the right and the left. Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote in the Washington Post that U.S. workers' jobs are less secure because of the deal, since companies can simply threaten to move to Mexico in order to get tax breaks from the government.  \"In essence, United Technologies took Trump hostage and won. And that should send a shock wave of fear through all workers across the country,\" Sanders wrote Thursday.  Even some conservatives said they didn't like the idea of an incoming administration getting this involved in negotiations to save one company, especially one with such a minimal impact on the overall economy. They say it smacks of government interference in the marketplace, which they think is a bad idea.  \"It makes sense for a president and his team to change a tax code, change the regulatory environment to help businesses,\" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative Washington think tank, told CNN. \"I'm not a big fan of this kind of negotiation. I think the more limited it is the better.\" ", "date": "NA", "author": "Chris Isidore and Eric Bradner", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/01/news/companies/donald-trump-carrier-jobs/index.html"},

And Ford's $2.5 billion engine and transmission plant in Mexico, which Trump cites often as an example of America losing jobs, is going ahead as planned, Ford said.  Neither of those facts stopped Trump from taking a victory lap on Monday.  \"I brought [Ford's Mexican investment plans] up in so many speeches, and frankly I think I embarrassed 'em,\" he told a crowd in New Hampshire. \"But Ford is now gonna build a massive plant in the United States, and every single person, even my harshest critics gave me credit for it.\"  On Sunday night, Trump tweeted \"word is that Ford Motor\" will cancel plans to build a new plant in Mexico.  Trump didn't stop at one tweet: \"Do you think I will get credit for keeping Ford in U.S. Who cares, my supporters know the truth. Think what can be done as president!\" and \"Do you think Hillary, Ben or Jeb could do this?\"   But in fact Ford said Monday that none of its plans have changed.  \"Ford has not spoken with Mr. Trump, nor have we made any changes to our plans,\" said a statement from the company.  \"We decided to move the F-650 and F-750 medium-duty trucks to Ohio Assembly in 2011, long before any candidates announced their intention to run for U.S. president,\" Ford said.  Ford added that it has invested $10.2 billion in U.S. plants since 2011 -- more than four times what it has invested in Mexico and Canada.  The October 2011 Ford announcement that it would move production of those trucks to Ohio was part of a labor deal with the United Auto Workers union.  The move saved about 1,000 jobs in Ohio. The first of the trucks built in that plant started rolling off the production line in August.  Automakers have been promising to shift work from Mexico and overseas to unionized plants in the U.S. as part of recent labor deals. Because of those guarantees, Ford added more than 12,000 U.S. hourly jobs in the last four years.

There is one Republican presidential candidate who can claim partial credit for Ford's decision to shift production of pickups to Ohio. That's Ohio Governor John Kasich, who helped pass tax cuts for Ford's Ohio plant a couple months after the UAW deal.  \"Together Ohio brought Ford back from Mexico,\" Kasich tweeted on Sunday. \"Our country needs real leadership and not empty, false rhetoric.\"  ", "date": "NA", "author": "Chris Isidore and Noah Gray", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/26/news/companies/donald-trump-ford-mexico/"},

Ford said there will be zero job losses in the U.S. as a result of the new plant in Mexico. The Wayne, Michigan, plant that now builds the Focus and C-Max that will move to Mexico will instead start building other models -- probably the new Ford Bronco SUV and Ranger small pickup.  \"Ford has been in the United States for more than 100 years. Our home is here. We will be here forever,\" said spokeswoman Christine Baker.  The company has 85,000 U.S. employees, up 28,000, or nearly 50%, in just the last five years. It has 8,800 employees at Mexican plants, and will add 2,800 jobs there when the new $1.6 billion plant opens there in 2018.  Ford committed to build new vehicles at the Michigan Assembly Plant to take the place of the Focus and C-Max when it reached a new contract late last year with the United Auto Workers union, which represents 3,900 hourly workers at the plant.

They then sell this information to marketers and other companies.  Diabetes, depression, herpes, yeast infections, erectile dysfunction and bed-wetting are just a few of the highly sensitive conditions for which consumer lists are available.  Federal law dictates that this information can't be used to deny anyone for a job or insurance coverage. But with little transparency about who is buying and using these lists, lawmakers and federal regulators say they are worried about other potentially harmful ways the information might be used.  For example, while a \"diabetes interest\" list could be used by a food manufacturer to offer coupons on sugar-free products, that same list could be used by an insurance company to classify a consumer as higher risk, regulators wrote in a recent Federal Trade Commission report.

Another company, Great Lakes List Management, hawks a list of households where Alzheimer's patients reside. It says the list could be used by \"a pharmaceutical company offering new medications.\" Great Lakes did not respond to requests for comment.  Many consumers assume that their medical information is protected by strict federal health privacy laws -- called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA.  However, HIPAA only applies to \"covered entities\" -- namely your doctor, health plan and any health care clearinghouse that processes your medical or billing information. That means your medical and prescription drug history stored by your doctor or local pharmacy are protected.

All of that information falls outside of HIPAA and can be gathered and sold by data brokers.

{"text": "Donald Trump's economic policies aren't getting good grades. His presidency would cost the U.S. economy $1 trillion over the next five years, according to Oxford Economics, a British forecasting firm with offices in the United States.  The analysis comes ahead of Trump's big speech on Thursday at the Economic Club of New York, where he's expected to offer more clarity on his economic policy promises.  Oxford Economics found that if fully implemented, Trump's economic, tax and immigration policies would cost 4 million U.S. jobs, weigh down global growth and U.S. consumer spending, and could spark a trade war with other nations.  \"Combining these policies together, the impact could be significantly negative for the U.S. economy,\" says Jamie Thompson, head of macro scenarios at Oxford Economics.  Oxford's figures are in line with other analysis. The University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Budget Model forecasts Trump's immigration policy costing 4 million jobs and Moody's economist Mark Zandi -- a Clinton supporter -- also forecasts a similar job loss under Trump.  Related: Trump's old school says immigration to cost 4 million jobs  Thompson argues that Trump could hurt the very workers he says he'll help in America's manufacturing sector. In Oxford's \"adverse case scenario\" Trump slaps a 35% tariff on goods coming from Mexico, like cars and air conditioners.  But the problem is that almost half of the parts in those cars and ACs originate from U.S. suppliers. In other words, U.S. manufacturers who ship to Mexico stand to lose customers if the U.S. imposes a tariff on the products they contribute to.  CNNMoney also found similar stories when we spoke to denim manufacturers in South Carolina. They send an overwhelming amount of denim to Mexico, where it is cut and sewn into jeans, which are sold in America. They say NAFTA, the trade deal with Mexico and Canada, is critical.  \"Without NAFTA, we would be out of business,\" says Rich Turner, who employs 2,700 workers at his denim plant in Mauldin, S.C. Turner is still supporting Trump because he refuses to vote for Hillary Clinton.  Related: Remember Smoot-Hawley, America's last trade war  American buyers would stand to lose too if all of Trump's policies are implemented. Those tariffs would make the price of cars and other goods more expensive. Oxford forecasts consumer spending to decline by 4.4% over four years.  Trump's team acknowledges that a grocery trip would become more expensive with tariffs on other countries' goods.  \"(Prices could go up) if those tariffs were actually enacted as proposed,\" Tom Barrack, one of Trump's economic advisers, agreed in an interview with CNNMoney's Cristina Alesci.  But Barrack counters that Trump would also bring back good-paying jobs to the United States. Trump would do that by creating an economic stimulus plan and lowering corporate taxes to convince companies to return offshore profits to the U.S. and spend that cash on new jobs and factories.  Related: The Reagan tariffs Trump loves to talk about  Many trade experts argue that raising tariffs on China and Mexico would only cause American companies to shift jobs to the next cheapest place, such as Vietnam or Central America.  Trump's trade proposals \"would be ultimately self-defeating, and harm the U.S. economy and harm U.S. manufacturers,\" says Thompson, the economist from Oxford Economics.

{"text": "You likely know about your credit score -- that key measure that influences everything from your monthly car payment to your ability to buy a home. But there are dozens of other consumer scores that are impacting your daily life that you have no idea about. Data brokers, analytics firms and retailers are creating hundreds of \"secret\" consumer scores that rank you on everything from the likelihood you will keep your job to how likely you are to commit fraud, according to a report released Wednesday by nonprofit World Privacy Forum.  Marketers, financial institutions, wireless phone service providers, law enforcement agencies and others use these scores to do everything from promoting new products to investigating crimes.  Yet, while these consumer scores are pervasive, most consumers don't know they exist. Rarely are they able to view their scores, find out how they are compiled or used or correct inaccuracies like they can on a credit report, the World Privacy Forum found.  \"Consumers have little to no ability to learn when their lives are affected in a major or minor way by a consumer score that they never heard about,\" the report's authors Pam Dixon and Bob Gellman wrote. The two are calling for more transparency and government scrutiny of consumer scores.  Related: Data brokers selling lists of rape victims, AIDS patients  Dixon and Gellman acknowledge that some scores could be used to help consumers, by providing them with targeted deals and discounts, for example. But they say some scores infringe on a consumer's privacy and can affect their eligibility for everything from a new job to affordable insurance. Inaccuracies could also cause a consumer to be mislabeled as a fraudster and shut out of important lines of credit.  \"Whether a consumer receives a coupon for a free soda is not a big deal,\" they wrote. \"Whether a consumer can complete a transaction is of significant consequence.\"  Here are just a few of the hundreds of scores that the World Privacy Forum uncovered:  Consumer profitability score: Using factors like your income, one company sells a score which predicts how likely you will be to pay your debts. The higher your score, the more likely you are to be a \"profitable\" customer (and a target of marketers).  Churn score: Many companies, such as wireless carriers and cable companies, create scores that predict how likely you are to take your business to a competitor. Get deemed a flight risk, and you may be offered a better deal. On the flip side, get labeled a stable customer and you may end up paying higher rates.  Related: What your zip code reveals about you  Job security score: One company sells a score that uses employment and unemployment data, economic trends and forecasts to predict the probability that you will lose your job, and as a result not be able to pay your bills.  Banks sometimes use these lists in order to limit their losses, according to the report.  Medication adherence score: Do you always follow your doctor's orders? Or do you skip a pill here and there? One firm sells a score that predicts the likelihood you will follow a prescription plan, based on factors ranging from age to home ownership, that is designed to let pharmacies and insurers know when a patient is at risk and needs a medication reminder.  As long as the score does not use your own protected health information, it would not be protected by privacy laws.  Fraud scores: Widely used by retailers, credit card issuers and other companies, fraud scores indicate whether a consumer may be posing as someone else or attempting to perpetuate a fraud of some sort.  Related: What information is the government buying about you?  While the scores are an important fraud and loss prevention tool, they can also create major headaches for any consumer who gets incorrectly labeled or is a victim of identity theft.  Get branded as a high risk and you could be declined on credit card purchases or rejected on loan applications, among other things. And unlike a credit score, you typically have few rights to access or contest a fraud score.  Custom scores: Some retailers create their own custom scores using sophisticated analysis of their massive databases of customer purchases and demographic information. The most famous example: Target's pregnancy predictor score, which used a consumer's shopping history to predict that she was pregnant even before she had told family members.  Law enforcement scores: A variety of government scores are used for safety, anti-terrorism and other law enforcement purposes, but very little is known about how this information is used, the report stated.

But there are ways to prevent Big Data from selling your health information to the highest bidder.  Here are five things you can do to make sure your information stays private.  1. Use a different e-mail address: Many marketing lists are compiled based on the registration information you provide when you sign up for health-related websites, said Pam Dixon, executive director of the nonprofit World Privacy Forum.  Once you provide your name and email address, it's easy to match the information you provide with your other personal information, like your address, how much money you make and the things you buy.  Related: Big Data knows you are sick, tired and depressed  If you must register for a health site, Dixon recommends using a fake name and an email address that you don't use for any other purpose.  2. Watch out for free or discounted health offers: That free health screening or discounted drug offer probably comes with strings attached. Often, whoever is sponsoring that freebie is looking to find out more about you.  So while the information you share with a doctor or other healthcare provider must be kept private under federal law, it's not protected if you take part in something like a free blood pressure screening or Body Mass Index reading at a health fair, shopping mall or pharmacy, according to the AARP.  3. Actually read the privacy policy: Don't just mindlessly click the \"accept\" box. Make sure you've actually read the policy before sharing your information with any health website or mobile app.  Pay attention to how -- and for what purpose -- your personal information will be used. The key phrase to look for is \"third party.\" If the policy says that your information can be used by or \"shared with\" a third party, it could end up being sold to a data broker or other companies, Dixon said.  If you don't want your information shared, try looking for a competing app or website that pledges not to share your data.  Related: Feds say it's time to regulate Big Data  4. Use cash: If you don't want your purchases of Abreva to land you on a list of people with cold sores, don't pay with plastic.  While prescription drug purchases are covered by federal health privacy laws, over-the-counter purchases are not. Transactions using a credit or debit card can be tracked easily so Dixon recommends using cash (or a prepaid gift card) to make health-related purchases.  5. Don't over share: Your friends and family may not be the only ones reading your Facebook page or following you on Twitter.  Computer programs can scrape social media websites for keywords, ranging from \"cancer\" to \"pregnancy\" so think twice before posting your any medical news.

{"text": "The lavish condo that was home to the late comedian Joan Rivers for 25 years was listed for sale Monday for $28 million. The 11-room penthouse occupies three floors of a limestone mansion in New York City's Upper East Side neighborhood. Rivers' daughter, Melissa Rivers, put the home up for sale a day after she accepted her mother's posthumous Grammy award for a recording of her memoir, Diary of a Mad Diva.  The home was originally built in 1903 for a family of Gilded Age millionaires and socialites. It was later converted into condos in the 1930s.  Soon after she acquired it in 1990, Rivers restored the unique Louis-XIV-inspired d\u00e9cor of the property's two large entertainment spaces -- an ornate gilded ballroom and music room. The spaces are so large that the home is capable of hosting grand social events for up to 125 people, according to Corcoran, which is listing the property.  Those gilded rooms, which served as the ballroom and reception hall in the original mansion, are like nothing else available in the city, said Leighton Candler, the agent representing the property for Corcoran.  \"These gigantic mansions, a lot of them were torn down and now high rises are where they stood,\" said Candler. \"People just don't know that apartments like this still exist.\"  Related: New York City's priciest homes  The palatial property also includes a more intimate wood-paneled library and dining room, four bedrooms, 4.5 baths, two kitchens and five fireplaces.

{"text": "The rise of ride-sharing services means that people are opting to be chauffeured instead of taking the driver's seat. And a company called Zendrive wants to make sure we're in safe hands. The startup collects data on drivers using sensors on their smartphones. The sensors can detect everything from when a driver is speeding, to when they're talking on the phone or slamming on the brakes.  Ride-sharing companies like Shuddle have integrated the technology into their apps to track their fleets. Drivers are given a score based on whether they're driving aggressively, speeding or glued to their smartphones.  \"People are very distracted by phone use. Drivers are getting worse,\" said Zendrive cofounder Jonathan Matus, who previously worked at Google (GOOGL, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30).  \"This is something that is a global phenomenon and we're trying to help fleets deal with it using very sophisticated tools,\" he added.  Like most tech companies, Zendrive is providing companies with a host of data about drivers.   It recently conducted a study with SherpaShare, which integrated its technology into its app. SherpaShare is used by over 10,000 contract drivers (who work at companies like Uber and Lyft) to compile hours of work, number of miles driven and expenses for various driving gigs.  Using data from June to August of this year, Zendrive uncovered which cities have the safest drivers -- meaning they're less distracted by their phones and are speeding less.  The cities with the safest rideshare drivers were Seattle, San Francisco, Austin, Portland, Oregon, and San Diego. The least safe were Atlanta, Fort Worth, Houston, Miami and Dallas.  Matus isn't quite sure what to do with the data but says it raises interesting points for cities and fleets.  \"There's the curious case of Austin,\" said Matus, noting that Austin was among the top three cities while other Texas cities were significantly less safe. \"Is it something about how cities are planned in Texas? Is Austin doing something structurally different? Your guess is as good as mine.\"  Additionally, Zendrive found that the safest time of day to take a rideshare was weekday mornings (6 a.m. to 9 a.m.), and weekend evenings (9 p.m. to 12 a.m.). Best to avoid weekday afternoons and weekend mornings -- as that was when drivers were most distracted.  According to Matus, the vast majority of accidents are the result of human error -- and roughly 30% of accidents involve phone usage.  Matus said Zendrive gives companies knowledge about what's going on in vehicles so they can track driving behavior over time and know how to better train their drivers.  And it's beneficial for companies. In September, Zendrive announced its first insurance partner, which will give a 10% discount to companies with fleets that have good Zendrive scores.  \"We're helping this economy grow,\" said Matus. \"We're helping it be safer and cheaper.\" ", "date": "NA", "author": "Sara Ashley O'Brien", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/07/technology/zendrive-city-data/index.html"},
{"text": "Donald Trump's tax proposals could spur more economic growth and more jobs ... for awhile. But by 2024, that positive effect turns negative. His plan would slow growth created relative to what's expected under today's policies.  Hillary Clinton's plan would do the opposite -- having a somewhat negative effect on growth in the first several years, and a more positive one after that.  That's according to a new macroeconomic analysis by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School in collaboration with the Tax Policy Center.  \"In the short run, Trump's tax plan reduces taxes on business and higher income Americans, boosting investment and work, which results in more economic growth. However, in the long run, the Trump tax plan increases federal debt more than current policy, resulting in less economic growth,\" Penn Wharton noted in its report.  Here's why: Even accounting for the positive macroeconomic effects, the Trump tax cuts are estimated to reduce revenue by $7 trillion in the first decade alone. Absent offsetting measures, that means the United States would have to borrow a lot more money than it already does. That, in turn, means the U.S. government will be competing with the private sector to attract investors' dollars, and that will drive money away from a productive part of the economy.  Related: What Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton want to do to your tax bill  \"If the tax cut substantially increases government debt ... the debt competes with private capital for household savings and international capital flows,\" the Penn Wharton report said.  Its model estimates that Trump's plan could add an additional 1.1% in 2018 relative to current law. But by 2024 that positive effect is erased and by 2027 it could lower GDP by 0.78%. By 2037, it could produce 4.6% less GDP than expected.  There are ways that the long-run effects of the revenue loss created by Trump's plan would not be negative. But the changes needed to offset them might not be realistic.  For instance, Trump and his economic advisers have asserted that revenue losses under his tax plan could be offset in part through spending cuts. But he's ruled out touching Medicare and Social Security. To fully offset the negative effects of the debt created by his tax plan, Trump would have to cut non-Medicare, non-Social Security spending by 50%, said Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model.  Or, Smetters noted, the amount of foreign investment in new U.S. debt would have to reach levels far above the historical average of 40%.  Trump camp rejects the analysis  The so-called \"dynamic scoring\" model used by Penn Wharton doesn't account for Trump's other economic proposals -- such as for trade, energy and regulation. Nor does it account for the economic effects of his spending plans, such as his proposal to boost infrastructure spending.  That's one reason why Trump's economic advisers essentially reject the findings.  \"It only looks at taxes. It tortures its result [by extending the window over 25 years]. It makes a wrong assumption about how debt affects [interest] rates. And it ignores the role of growth in the process,\" said Trump adviser Peter Navarro, an economist at the University of California-Irvine.  The Trump camp wants outside experts to score Trump's economic plan as a whole. They believe his trade and energy policies will spur enough growth to offset any revenue loss in his tax plan. Outside experts are dubious, but haven't been able to model his spending and other plans together both because of a lack of policy specifics and a lack of adequate modeling tools to do so, they say.  What about Clinton's plan?  The analysis found that the effects of Clinton's tax plan would essentially be the reverse of Trump's.  Clinton's tax plan would raise taxes largely on high-income households but also businesses. As a result, \"in the short run, [her plan] dampens investment and work, which results in less economic growth. However, in the long run, the Clinton tax plan reduces federal debt relative to current policy resulting in more economic growth,\" the Penn Wharton report noted.  Overall her tax plan raises more than $1 trillion -- all of it earmarked for her spending proposals -- so it's not expected to add to the debt in the long run  Her plan would produce 0.3% less GDP than currently projected for 2018 but that negative effect starts to turn positive by 2028, according to the UPenn/Wharton model. And by 2037, it would produce 0.7% more GDP than would be the case under today's policies.  Like the Trump camp, the Clinton campaign would have preferred an analysis of the economic effects of all her plans taken together.  \"[B]ecause this analysis only takes into account the candidates' tax plans, it doesn't show the truly stark differences between their economic visions],\" said senior policy advisor Jacob Leibenluft. \"As other analyses have shown, Secretary Clinton's investments in areas like infrastructure, innovation and education will create good-paying jobs, whereas Donald Trump's harmful proposals on immigration and trade will result in a recession.\"  Correction: The original version of this article incorrectly stated that Clinton's plan is estimated to generate 4% more GDP in 2037.

{"text": "Donald Trump is still going after Ford. The Republican nominee reaffirmed his plans to slap a 35% tax on Ford's cars made in Mexico and sold in the United States.  \"When that [Ford] car comes back across the border into our country that now comes in free, we're gonna charge them a 35% tax. And you know what's gonna happen, they're never going to leave,\" Trump told Fox on Thursday morning.  Ford CEO: Donald Trump is wrong about Mexico  That would spell bad news for Ford, which announced Wednesday that it would move all production of its small cars to Mexico in the next two years. Ford's spokesperson says the production shift won't result in any U.S. job losses.  Ford already has a big footprint in Mexico. It employs 8,800 employees there.  In the U.S., Ford employs 85,000 people.  Between January and August, Ford shipped 265,000 cars from Mexico to the United States, according to the Mexican Association of the Automobile Industry (AMIA).  Ford shipped nearly $4 billion worth of cars in the first half of the year to the United States, according to Panjiva, a global trade analytics firm in New York.  Related: Trump would cost the U.S. economy $1 trillion  If Trump levied a 35% tariff on all those cars, Ford would have paid $1.4 billion in taxes for just the first six months. For all of 2016, that would translate to $2.8 billion. That would be more than Ford's profit in its most recent quarter.  It would immediately make Ford cars more expensive for Americans.  \"You put tariffs up and [American] consumers are going to pay more,\" says Christopher Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva.  The tariff would also have huge ramifications for trade ties between the United States and Mexico, its third largest trading partner. To be clear, Trump would need Congress' approval to impose tariffs on another country.  Related: Donald Trump pledges 4% economic growth. How realistic is that?  \"If you want to put tariffs on autos, you have to tear up NAFTA,\" says Rogers. \"A 35% tariff is not a small tariff on a large product group. Mexico isn't going to say 'Yeah sure, whatever.'\"  Trump has repeatedly threatened to renegotiate or \"terminate\" NAFTA, the free trade deal between Canada, Mexico and America that allows Ford and others to ship cars duty-free across borders.  Trump does not need Congress to scrap NAFTA but experts warn he would risk retaliation from Mexico in the form of tariffs of U.S. goods shipped to Mexico.  Mexico's automobile industry has become a staple of its economy over the past two decades as American carmakers have shifted production there.  A year ago, Trump talked about imposing tariffs a lot. He often talked about imposing a 35% tariff on Mexico and 45% on goods coming from China.  Related: Immigration economics: what you need to know  However in recent months, he had cooled down such talk, saying he would use tariffs but didn't throw out any figures like he used to.  On Thursday, he went back to his original claim of a 35% tariff and doubled down on his anti-NAFTA rhetoric.  \"NAFTA has destroyed our country,\" Trump said during a Q&A session after a speech at the Economic Club of New York.  Large tariffs would mean that Americans would pay more. History has played out that way. When Ronald Reagan put a quota on the number of cars Japan could ship to the United States, American carmakers hiked up car prices by $1,000 on average, knowing they would face less foreign competition.  And the tariff probably wouldn't be limited to Ford. If it were only on Ford, its cars would be more expensive than others who produce in Mexico and sell in the U.S., which include General Motors (GM), Honda (HMC), Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAF).  Ford would then stand to lose in its home market to foreign competitors. The optics of that wouldn't bode well for Trump, experts say.  \"Ford -- an American company -- is going to lose out to non-American companies. That's not going to go down great,\" argues Rogers.

That's actually a slight decrease from last quarter's survey.  \"Capex will follow economic growth,\" says Oberhelman. The CEO survey predicts 2% economic growth next year. Trump has promised 4% once he's president.

{"text": "The Ford Mustang and I are roughly the same age. This gives me hope because I recently spent some time with what very well may be the best Mustang ever made. Of course, I can't guarantee that this is the best Mustang ever made because I haven't driven every Mustang ever made. Who has? But the Shelby GT350 has to be up there.  Way up there.  The main ingredient is the engine. And, wow! What an engine. It's a 5.2-liter V8 that spins to a coarsely shrieking 8,250 revolutions per minute. That's roughly 1,500 to 2,000 RPM above what a typical V8 can manage. It makes an amazing noise that sends a chill fingering its way up from the base of your spine as the engine winds itself up, way beyond what you thought possible, in a high-pitched barrage of rapid-fire explosions.  This isn't just about speed and power. The Shelby GT350 is neither the fastest nor the most powerful Mustang ever made. With a top output of 526 horsepower, it's no match for the supercharged Shelby GT500 of a few years ago which produced 662 horsepower. The new GT350 can go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 4.3 seconds, according to Car & Driver magazine. In a world where a Tesla SUV can quietly blast to highway speeds in about three seconds it might be easy to forget that 4.3 seconds is still really fast. In the Shelby GT350, it definitely feels it.  Those Ford (F) engineers weren't spending all their time under the hood, either. This Mustang handles a curve better than any I can remember. Considering its overall practicality, which includes usable back seats and a fairly capacious trunk, even an ordinary Mustang offers a really good driving experience. It's balanced, gives you decent sensory feedback and is good fun to drive around on curvy roads.  Driving Shelby's new Daytona coupe  The GT350 just takes this up a notch or two. In Sport mode, with the suspension stiffened up, this car lives for tightly twisted roads. Even with all the engineering that's gone into making the GT350 light and well balanced it still feels fairly hefty, so I'm not going to say it's the best sports car I've ever driven, but this is the first Mustang I can recall that had me looking for a \"sharp curves\" warning signs. With its unique combination of agility and brute aggression, it is definitely among my favorites.  Also impressive was the fact that, in regular traffic, it felt little different from a your ordinary Mustang. Well, except for the fact that the GT350 is available only with a manual transmission. (That shifter, by the say, is a joy to use.)  While it's a compelling value compared to cars offering similar performance, the $55,000 starting price could put this pony car out of reach for a lot of ordinary folks. Fortunately, the Mustang comes in more variations than just about anything besides Coca-Cola. Even at this price, the GT350 is unquestionably my favorite flavor.

{"text": "If you live in Canada, you know a thing or two about being cold. And trying to stay warm. Take software developer Jamil Khan, for example. He got so tired of freezing his way through Toronto's harsh winter, he decided to do something about it.  So in January 2015 he quit his job as to pursue a somewhat crazy dream: to create the \"best winter coat in the world.\" He wondered, since technology was constantly transforming our lives, why weren't coat makers innovating?  His Smart Parka -- or Smarka -- started as a Kickstarter project and became one of the most successful campaigns in Kickstarter history.  Khan saw a gap in the outerwear market. He designed the Smarka with a dozen features that would make winter commutes warm and hassle-free: The parka includes built-in gloves, a detachable hood, a sewn-in scarf, electronic device pockets and removable lining -- extending the wear of the coat into the in-between seasons.   Despite his lack of experience as a clothing designer, more than 8,800 people backed his campaign -- pledging more than $2.4 million.  His company, North Aware, has now received 11,000 online orders from all over the world -- including cold winter cities like New York, Chicago and London, but also warmer climates such as Singapore.  \"The idea of adding gloves, a scarf and a removable extension to a winter coat was so obviously a winner,\" said Khan. \"I had no problem quitting my job and taking a risk.\"   Still, he tried and tested 15 different versions of the coat before he was happy with his final designs -- three styles for men, four for women, which can currently be pre-ordered from $349.  \"We get so many emails every day thanking us for finally creating something that everyone wanted,\" he said.  While making appealing parkas was easy for Khan, he said, creating a sustainable business model on a deadline was hard. \"We had five months to not only design, test and manufacture all the coats but also build processes around everything,\" he explained.  And as with some other hit Kickstarters, Smart Parka's success has led to growing pains. Because of the number of orders and its tight turnaround time, North Aware struggled to meet its promised shipment date -- and customers weren't happy. Some posted on Smart Parka's Kickstarter page in frustration asking when they should expect their coats to arrive.  \"We would have loved to have delivered on time,\" Khan said. \"But because we wanted to make sure every material we use met the quality standards that we set for ourselves we are behind. However, the good news is that our backers will enjoy their coat this winter.\"  The Smart Parka is sold online only, and exporting is a key component of the business. But as orders from the U.S. and E.U. increase, Khan said he'll look into opening international branches.  Khan said the company has been selling to the U.S. without any problems, but he wants to look into having a physical presence in the country. \"We don't want to restrict ourselves to just online, we also want to go into retail.\"  Khan said several leading retailers have expressed interest in stocking the Smart Parka. \"We've decided not to go with anyone yet,\" he said, but added that they'll start considering the opportunity later on this season.  Originally North Aware hoped to manufacture in Canada, but Khan said it would have taken two years to produce the jackets there because most factories were booked, or would be too slow.  Instead, it is manufacturing in China, in a facility he says has high standards and good working conditions. \"(We) paid a little more to get a factory that would produce the quality that we wanted.\" ", "author": "Bianca Britton", "date_pub": "December 6, 2016: 10:20 AM ET", "url": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/06/smallbusiness/smart-parka-kickstarter-north-aware/index.html", "title": "'Smart Parka' raised millions on Kickstarter.
