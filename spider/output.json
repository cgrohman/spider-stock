{"text": "While more bargain hunters opened their wallets for Black Friday weekend this year, on average they spent a little less than in 2015. More than 154 million consumers shopped in stores and online, which was about 3 million more than last year, according to a National Retail Federation survey released Sunday.  But the NRF, which tracks consumer visits and spending data, said those consumers also spent about $10 less on average -- about $290 this year compared to nearly $300 in 2015.  \"It was a strong weekend for retailers, but an even better weekend for consumers, who took advantage of some really incredible deals,\" said NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay in a news release.  Related: America goes shopping: Crowds hit the stores for Black Friday 2016  NRF officials attributed the difference mostly to heavy discounting brought on by a \"promotional environment\" in stores. According to the organization, about 36% of shoppers this year said all of their purchases were on sale, compared to 32.5% last year.  And although Black Friday is still a big hit for brick-and-mortar deal seekers, shoppers are slowly but increasingly turning online.  The NRF data shows more than 108 million people shopped online over the weekend, about 5 million more than last year. Meanwhile, 99 million people said they shopped in stores, down 3 million from last year. The numbers, the organization noted, are not mutually exclusive.  Related: Gun sales boom on Black Friday  Online shopping during the holiday weekend is a multi-billion dollar business, according to Adobe, which tracks data from online purchases across the 100 biggest retailers. Shoppers spent $1.9 billion online on Thanksgiving Day and another $3.3 billion on Friday, according to Adobe.  Despite the big numbers over the weekend, there aren't too many shoppers who are finished making purchases this holiday season, according to NRF.  The NRF survey found that only 9% of consumers are done shopping, down from 11% last year. Nearly a quarter of those surveyed haven't done any shopping yet, the data showed.  The NRF survey asked 4,330 consumers about their Thanksgiving weekend shopping plans and was conducted Friday and Saturday. It did not report how much in total the 154 million shoppers spent. The survey has a 1.5% margin of error.

{"text": "The home of Queen Elizabeth II -- Buckingham Palace -- is about to get a major refurbishment. The U.K. government has announced plans to spend \u00a3369 million ($458 million) to replace wiring and pipes on the property that are more than 60 years old. The overall design and exterior of the 775-room palace will remain the same.  \"The project seeks to prevent a serious risk of fire, flood and damage to both the building and the priceless Royal Collection of art belonging to the nation,\" the U.K. Treasury said.  The 10-year refurb is also expected to help improve visitor access.  The palace attracts millions of tourists each year. It has been the official London residence of the U.K.'s sovereigns since 1837.  The most critical construction work will start in April 2017.  A spokesperson at Buckingham Palace said the Queen will continue to reside in the building throughout the process.   Officials that oversee the royal family's annual funds have said the work is critical. They are recommending that annual government grants to the royal family be hiked by 67% over the next 10 years to pay for the work.  The royals currently get about \u00a340 million ($50 million) per year for costs related to travel, property maintenance and official duties. Businesses and real estate owned by the royals generate hundreds of millions of pounds each year, most of which ends up in government coffers.   Parliament must still approve the project. That's expected to happen by March 2017.  Lawmakers might be sympathetic about the need for a royal refurb because their own landmark home -- the Palace of Westminster -- is also suffering from decay. The complex includes parliamentary buildings and the Big Ben clock tower.  A parliamentary committee recently recommended that the entire complex get a renovation, which would cost at least \u00a33.5 billion ($4.3 billion). They warned about asbestos in the buildings, extensive stonework decay and plumbing problems.  The committee said parliament \"must act now\" so that the restoration work can begin early next decade.  -- Simon Cullen contributed reporting.

Alongside Cris Collinsworth, Tirico will call three games starting with the Green Bay Packers and the Washington Redskins this Sunday night. Tirico will also call the Pittsburgh Steelers and Indianapolis Colts game on Thanksgiving evening, as well as next Sunday's Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos game.  \"With the additional games on our schedule this season, it's nice to have a bye week,\" Michaels, 72, said in a statement. \"We're lucky to have someone of Mike's caliber to step in with Cris, Michele and the rest of the team.\"  Tirico, who spent a decade announcing ESPN's \"Monday Night Football,\" will also call a \"Thursday Night Football\" game on December 22 between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles.

{"text": "Amassing wealth without a trust fund is no easy feat. There isn't a magic recipe for making millions, but certain ingredients can help. Hard work, education, smart investing, frugality, risk taking, and plain ol' luck were some of the main factors ultra-high-net-worth investors used to describe themselves when surveyed by the Spectrem Group.  CNNMoney decided to dig a little deeper. We asked several wealth experts if they noticed any similar traits or attitudes among their clients with a net worth of at least $5 million.  Here's what surfaced:  Entrepreneurial: Going into business is a common path among the wealthy. While there are plenty of doctors, lawyers and corporate executives in the $5 million-plus group surveyed by Spectrem, those who go on to become business owners tend to build an even higher net worth.  Related: From broke to billionaire  Always on the clock: The 40-hour work week is like a part-time schedule for many, especially those who have built businesses. A 60- to 80-hour work week is more the norm, as are working vacations, according to certified financial planner Doug Flynn of Flynn Zito Capital Management.  High energy: Many high-net-worth individuals have a lot of energy, don't need much sleep, and enjoy generally upbeat attitudes, according to psychologist James Gottfurcht, who runs Los Angeles-based Psychology of Money Consultants.  Related: Do you have what it takes to be rich?  The super wealthy also tend to be visionaries, said psychologist Kristen Armstrong, a strategic wealth coach at Ascent Private Capital Management. She described many of her clients as \"force of nature\" people.  \"I see again and again that they have a really great ability to envision possible futures ... [and] an amazing ability to focus their efforts and energy once they see a possibility.\"  Extremely confident: Gottfurcht said most of his clients who made their wealth possess what he calls an \"expansive, healthy grandiosity.\" By that he means a sense of \"I can do anything.\"  They're also open to creative ways of achieving their goals.  Armstrong, too, said her clients have great confidence in themselves and others, and firmly believe the world will accommodate their business ideas.  Also common, though, among some of Gottfurcht's wealthiest clients is what he termed \"narcissistic personality disorder.\" That is, they think they're special, \"require excessive admiration,\" have a high sense of entitlement and lack empathy for others, he said.  Related: Rich, really rich, and ultra rich  Discerning: For all their confidence, Armstrong's clients know they're not the smartest person in the room on every given issue. But they know to surround themselves with people who are -- which will help them realize their vision.  Among business owners, those who do best are the ones who move past sole proprietorship, and partner with others to expand their enterprises, said Flynn.  Modest: Despite glamorous Hollywood portrayals of the rich life, many multi-millionaires live more modestly. Most of Flynn's richest clients have chosen not to bump up their lifestyles in lockstep with their growing wealth.  \"They still wear their old plaid shirt,\" he said. Or at least the men do.  Related: Sorry 99%ers, you can't afford these perks  Risk tolerant, but not impulsive: Anyone who runs a business is by nature a risk taker, Flynn noted. But there are no investing swashbucklers among his clients.  They have some short-term investments but tend to have a longer time horizon than most investors. Whether they invest in a stock or a building, they stick with it as long as it still makes sense to them.  But they won't go all in on one bet, according to Flynn.  \"There's always the guy who bets it all on something, gets lucky and then gets out. But that's not the recipe for most people,\" Flynn said.

{"text": "When a watch costs $40,000, you don't want to end up with buyer's remorse. Enter Eleven James, a company that offers men the chance to try out a new watch for a few months at a time, by allowing its members to rent different luxury watches several times a year.  Like NetJets, which lets customers buy \u00e0 la carte flights on private planes, Rent the Runway for pricey party dresses and Bag Borrow or Steal for high-end handbags, Eleven James gives customers access to luxury watches they may not be able to afford or may just want to test out without the five-figure price tag and lifetime commitment.  Users make two primary choices: what type of watches they want to wear and how frequently they want to change. There are currently three tiers, based on watches that retail for $10,000, $20,000 and $40,000. They then choose how many times they want to switch it up -- between three and six times per year. They fill out a preference sheet based on brands and styles they're interested in, and work with a concierge to figure out which watches they'll try next.  Membership for the least expensive watches, brands like Breitling, Panerai and Rolex, start at $199 per month, or $2,150 per year. On the high end, for watches like Patek Philippe and A. Lange & Sohne, it can reach $1,379 per month, or $14,900 per year.  Related: 13 things to know about the Apple Watch  In an age when a clock is displayed on any of the expensive electronic devices people already carry, why would anyone pay to borrow a device that only tells time?  According to Randy Brandoff, Eleven James' founder and CEO, the watch is still what makes an outfit, and there's a tremendous amount of heritage and craftsmanship that many people, especially in the professional sphere, still appreciate.  But because it's such a huge purchase, and a person can only wear one at a time, the idea of getting to try out a number of different watches without first having to buy one is appealing, he said.  Santo Rosabianca is one customer who'd grown tired of his old Omega. But after signing up with Eleven James, he suddenly had new options that suited his tastes -- a Chopard Grand Prix de Monaco to fit his Formula 1 fandom, and an Italian-made Panerai to appeal to his Italian heritage.  \"Everyone I meet compliments me and it's brought me new business. It's a real conversation starter,\" he said. \"I've been really blessed by it.\"  Of course, it appeals to collectors who are intrigued by the idea of trying out all kinds of watches and models several times a year. But it's also bringing in a new customer.  \"We're seeing millennials who, as adults, are getting ever more curious,\" he said. \"It's a pretty big leap to go from an iPhone to a Rolex, so they want to try them out.\"  That's good news for the watch industry, since Brandoff said the company is attracting clients who weren't yet collecting or had become apathetic because they didn't have any variety. It makes sense, then, that 85% of its members said they were more likely to purchase a watch within the next year because of the service.  Brent Handler was one of them. He ended up purchasing the first watch he was sent to try from Eleven James. He owned a Cartier watch his wife bought him before, and didn't think he needed to spend $10,000 on another one, until he became \"enamored with\" the Zenith watch he was borrowing.  \"I'm 46 years old. I have three kids. There aren't that many new things that I get to experience,\" he said. \"But when I get a call six times a year from a concierge saying, 'what kind of watch do you want?' that's something to look forward to.\"  Eleven James also avoids the regret that often comes with make a big watch purchase. Eric Wind, a contributor to the online watch magazine Hodinkee, said that many people lament that they didn't know that much about watches or didn't know what they would like when they bought an expensive watch, and then they're stuck with it.  \"Watch tastes typically evolve over time and the luxury watch rental services provide users with that commodity of time -- literally,\" he said.

{"text": "Any last questions we had about the Apple Watch were answered Monday afternoon. During an event in San Francisco, CEO Tim Cook and other executives announced key details about the Apple Watch, including when it will go on sale, where it will be available, and exactly how much it costs.  Here's what we now know about Apple's first wearable device:  1. The Apple Watch will go on sale online and by reservation in Apple stores on April 24.   Pre-orders begin April 10.   2. The Watch will be available to customers in nine markets, including the U.S. The others are Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United Kingdom.  3. The cheapest Apple Watch -- the 38mm sport model -- will cost $349, as expected. The 42mm (which is the height from top to bottom of the watch) will cost $399. The most expensive version of the Apple Watch, called the Apple Watch Edition, will start at $10,000 and cost as much as $17,000.  4. On a full charge, the Apple Watch battery should last up to 18 hours. This is critical, since the Apple Watch needs to be continuously connected to an iPhone in order to work, which can be a big battery drain.   5. The Apple Watch will be available in three models: The Apple Watch Sport, the Apple Watch and the Apple Watch Edition.   6. The watches are made from anodized aluminum (Apple Watch Sport), stainless steel (Apple Watch) and 18-karat gold (Apple Watch Edition). The Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition screens will be crafted from sapphire crystal, the same material used in luxury watches. The Apple Watch Sport will feature an Ion-X glass display.   7. There are only two buttons on the watch.   8. Each model will come in two sizes: a 38mm, or 1.5 inch (height), and 42 mm or 1.7 inch.   9. The Apple Watch needs an iPhone to connect to the Internet. And not just any iPhone -- the oldest iPhone it will connect to is the iPhone 5, and it has to be running iOS 8.2 software, which is available for download as of Monday. It connects to the iPhone via Bluetooth.   10. Each Apple Watch model will be available in two colors: Stainless steel and black stainless steel for the Apple Watch; silver aluminum and gray aluminum for the Apple Watch Sport; and 18-karat yellow gold and 18-karat rose gold for the Apple Watch Edition.   11. There are six types of wristbands: 1) a metal band with a traditional clasp 2) a rubber sport band 3) a magnetic leather band 4) a leather band with a classic buckle 5) a leather band with a modern buckle and 6) a flexible metal magnetic band.   12. You can use it to work out. The Apple Watch will have a heart rate sensor and an accelerometer to measure body movements, including step count. The watch does not have GPS, which comes as a major disappointment to fitness enthusiasts.   13. It will \"tap\" you when you have notifications. You can also tap it back, sending other Watch owners taps that can emulate a sender's heartbeat.

{"text": "Bots, as we know them today, are a little dumber than we'd initially hoped. \"Bots aren't Siri yet,\" Matt Schlicht told CNNMoney.  Schlicht, a former product manager at Ustream and a Y Combinator alum, has become something of a bot guru.  He's the creator of Chatbots Magazine, which has 200,000 readers a month, and launched an invite-only \"bots\" group on Facebook that has 17,000 members.  And on Wednesday, he's launching an invite-only version of Octane AI, a platform that hopes to do for bots what MailChimp has done with email newsletters. Octane AI will help businesses set up chatbots on Facebook Messenger in minutes. For now, it's free and will soon open up to all.  \"Everybody thinks that bots are artificially intelligent personalities that understand everything you say to it, but this just isn't the case right now,\" he said, adding that the technology isn't there yet.   When Facebook (FB, Tech30) announced its Bots for Messenger platform in April, it presented a world where bots could simplify administrative tasks on everything from reservations to banking. But the reality is, \"they aren't super smart [right now], but they can be simple and valuable if done right,\" said Schlicht.  Many businesses don't know where to start when it comes to building a bot, though.  Related: Who's donating to Trump? This bot will tell you  Octane AI wants to help businesses create chatbots by offering a set of plugins to choose from and customize. The bots can then automatically respond to common questions, feature content, send notifications and schedule meetings.  As messaging apps become the preferred form of communication, businesses need to find ways to engage, said Schlicht, who cofounded Octane AI with Ben Parr, author of Captivology and a former tech journalist.  Schlicht said celebrities are typically keen to try out new products and services first. With that in mind, they've signed up artists like 50 Cent, Aerosmith and KISS, who've started using Octane AI's bot creator to promote their music.  Related: Facebook's bots show early signs of success  I decided to test these bots. What would 50 Cent say to me if I chatted him on Facebook Messenger?  I searched for 50 Cent on Facebook Messenger and was prompted to \"Get Started.\" 50 Cent then asked if I wanted to be added to his list of VIPs to receive messages when he had new music to release. I clicked \"Yes,\" and he responded: \"Ima send you a message when I drop some new #EFFENVODKA #FRIGO.\"  I then asked him whether he was broke -- he sent me gun emojis. I stopped there.  Octane AI already has the backing of investors, raising $1.5 million in funding in a round led by General Catalyst Partners.\"To be honest, right now bots are more similar to lightweight apps than artificially intelligent personalities,\" Schlicht wrote in a blog post he shared with CNNMoney.

{"text": "One of the hottest tech gifts of 2016 may be a throwback to 1985. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to launch a tiny-sized NES Classic Edition -- a system so petite it can fit in the palm of your hand. The news pulled at the heartstrings of everyone who grew up in the '80s, evoking memories of sitting on the carpet of your childhood home and defeating King Bowser in the final level of Mario Bros.  More than three decades later, Nintendo (NTDOF) has stuffed 30 of its classic games -- from all the Mario Bros. franchises to Legends of Zelda, Pac-Man and Castlevania -- into one mini console (5 inches x 4 inches x 1.6 inches). The system, due out November 11, serves them up in a Netflix-style menu that makes it easy for scrolling. You won't find a single physical game cartridge included.  Considering those games have been available for download on Nintendo's Wii system for years, it was unclear if packing them into a retro-style console was a gimmick or something worth the $60 price tag.  Related: Nintendo Switch console looks like the future of gaming  But the magic of classic Nintendo is unquestionably preserved in this mini system. I can't remember reviewing another product that's made me smile quite as much.  The USB-powered system comes with one controller -- the second is sold separately ($10). But it's possible to switch to two-player mode and trade off using the same controller. Set up is easy: Plug it into an outlet or your computer and connect the HDMI cable to a TV or monitor.   Also included: gritty graphics, familiar music and the satisfaction of recalling which green pipes in Mario Bros. transport you to coin-filled secret lairs.  Once you've powered up the system, you'll select from one of three display options: \"Pixel Perfect,\" which gives you a modern sharper image; a 4:3 aspect ratio mode; and another that slightly (and purposefully) distorts the picture for nostalgia's sake.  The games hold up, if you can get past the simplicity and old-school graphics. But what makes the experience special is that you're playing through the iconic console itself.   If you purchase an original Nintendo classic console on eBay now, it will cost at least $100 -- and that's before investing in games. The fact that the NES mini puts everything you need into one portable package is not only convenient but also cost efficient.  While there's a lot to love about the console, there are a few areas in need of improvement. The short length of the controller's cord isn't optimized for sitting on the couch -- perhaps that's why we always played on the floor years ago.  Related: Nintendo's future may hinge on Switch  The system also doesn't connect to the internet. This means it's not upgradable. You'll be satisfied with 30 games, but it limits Nintendo from ever pushing out other titles, features or updates.  Nintendo isn't too concerned about this; after all, it's saving the real innovation for its Nintendo Switch console -- part mobile, part home system -- coming in early 2017.  But overall, the old adage holds up for Nintendo's throwback console: Good things really do come in small packages.

{"text": "The ugly Christmas sweater trend is getting a creative twist. UglyChristmasSweater.com -- which sold $5 million worth of intentionally hideous holiday sweaters last year -- is known for its unique designs. You'll find everything from a sweater with a stuffed moose popping out of the chest to cardigans featuring hanging LED light ornaments.  But now, for the first time since its 2012 launch, the Detroit-based business is letting people create their own designs. You'll never again show up to a ugly sweater party wearing the same thing as someone else.  The company recently rolled out a \"create-your-own-sweater\" tool on its site.  Related: 14 coolest toys for this holiday season  Here's how it works: First you'll need to click on the tool to receive the basic sweater template, which features five colors and kitschy holiday-inspired background patterns, such as like reindeers and snowflakes.  Next, you'll want to upload a photo, logo or hand drawn sketch to the platform. It's also possible to add text, although it's limited to seven characters. After picking your size and the quantity you want, the order request goes directly to a factory in China. It'll ship 10 days later.  Customization isn't cheap: One sweater costs $99.99. Orders of one will be knitted by hand.  However, the price drops to $30 when you order 250 sweater or more. (Prices for the firm's ready-made ugly sweaters range from $19 and $65)  Related: Patagonia is donating 100% if its Black Friday sales  Fred Hajjar, cofounder of UglyChristmasSweater.com, said the new feature is necessary for the business.  \"Because the ugly [holiday] sweater trend has become much more mainstream, we're competing with mass retailers like Macy's (M), J.C. Penney (JCP) and Wal-Mart (WMT),\" said Hajjar. \"We had to continue to differentiate ourselves.\"  But it appears UglyChristmasSweater.com is the first to offer custom-design options.  Although the online tool took three months to build, the manufacturing side of the project is more than a year in the making.  \"Typically, only five or six colors are used in automated knitting, so we have to convert an image with multiples colors down to [much less],\" Hajjar said.  Language and cultural barriers posed a problem, too.  \"We have to make sure the factories in China correctly understand the text sent with images,\" said Hajjar.   With that in mind, his team carefully inspects each design for accuracy and to reject inappropriate material before it is shipped.  The customization feature is already getting attention: Uber, Lyft, Spotify and Ellen DeGeneres' show have ordered custom sweaters.  The company hopes to expand the tool next year, such as allowing users to add glitter or other ornaments. In the meantime, it plans to capitalize on the new President-Elect.  \"We have designed Trump-themed ugly sweaters for the holidays, too,\" said Hajjar.  Those designs will be available starting December 5.

After climbing rapidly for years, global smartphone shipments are expected to inch up just 1.6% in 2016, and they'll actually decline in developed markets like the U.S. and Canada, according to IDC forecasts. That's down from 10.4% growth last year.  Samsung, the word's largest smartphone maker, is also grappling with its own particular difficulties following the debacle involving its Galaxy Note 7 phone.

{"text": "Early cancer screenings can be life saving. But traditional diagnostic tests are time consuming, costly and involve some level of an invasive procedure -- a blood test, mammogram, pap test, biopsies.  Now, a newer diagnostic option developed by IBM aims to make cancer screening non-invasive, fast and cheap.  The alternative method, called \"lab-on-a-chip,\" boils down the conventional cancer screening process by using a small silicon chip and body fluid like urine or saliva. It could deliver screening results in just a few hours and reduce costs by as much as half.  IBM Research teamed up with Mount Sinai Hospital more than two years ago for the project.  Related: IBM diagnoses skin cancer with a computer  Here's how it works: The screening requires a patient sample to get started. The sample includes a drop of body fluid -- not a tissue sample, which is typical with biopsies.  The process tests the liquid for exosomes, known as tiny sacs of cellular material encased in membrane. IBM's technology then separates the exosomes from the liquid sample, which contains vital genetic information.  The non-invasive nature of the approach makes screenings easier and ultimately possible to detect cancer when it first emerges.   \"We realized in the last few years that exosomes aren't trash bins filled with garbage being thrown out by cells,\" said Dr. Carlos Cordon-Cardo, Chair of Pathology at Mount Sinai Medical Center, in New York. \"They provide very important data about the mother cells, including DNA, viruses and biomakers, to help us with early diagnoses of cancer.\"  A team at IBM Research, led by Joshua Smith, designed the chip that's placed into a cartridge with up to a milliliter of fluid sample. The chip itself includes a pattern of columns.   Meanwhile, the technology -- called nanoDLD -- allows the patient's sample to flow through the chip's columns, which separates and sorts small exosomes from larger ones.  \"You can visualize the separation process like traffic on a highway that separates into two roads with one going into a low-clearance tunnel and the other going around it,\" said Smith. \"Smaller cars will go through the tunnel and larger vehicles carrying potentially hazardous material will be forced to take the detour route. Traffic is effectively separated by size and contents.\"  This simplifies the exosomes screening process.  In addition to being a diagnostic tool, the system could allow real-time patient monitoring.  \"We can quickly test how patients are reacting to medication or if even they've developed resistance to it,\" said Cardo. \"This way we can detect side effects much sooner and also avoid unnecessary treatment.\"  Related: The $54 million hospital without any beds  The ability to sort and identify biomarkers using chip-based technologies opens the door to quickly and effectively identifying other chronic diseases, as well as viruses like the flu or Zika. However, it's about three to five years away from broad adoption and is still undergoing clinical trials.  \"Before it's commercialized, we must make sure results are accurate for thousands of tests,\" Cardo added.  Insurers also need to be educated about the diagnostic and cost benefits.  Looking ahead, Cardo is optimistic the lab-on-a-chip diagnostic technology could hit mainstream use -- even during annual exams.  \"We are caring for people when they become sick right now in healthcare,\" said Cardo. \"But this [process] could become a low-cost way to test and monitor patients before. This would help us get ahead of diseases so we can treat them much more effectively.\" ", "date": "November 18, 2016: 2:40 PM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/15/technology/ibm-chip-speeds-up-cancer-process/index.html", "author": "Parija Kavilanz"},
{"text": "Every social website has harassment. It's difficult to combat and even define. As hate speech and online bullying come to a head, the tech industry is working on solutions while keeping free speech alive.  At Fusion's Real Future Fair in Oakland on Tuesday, technologists discussed how to protect people online, and what sorts of constraints -- technical and sociological -- handicap safety and privacy.  \"A big flaw with engineers in particular is relying too much on data and thinking that code can be impartial,\" said Danielle Leong, an application engineer on the community and safety team at GitHub.  Related: Twitter launches new tools to fight harassment  \"And it's not -- it's built by people, and people have their own internal biases. They're going to build that into their code no matter how impartial they think they are.\"  Leong joined Caroline Sinders, a Buzzfeed Eyebeam Open Lab fellow and machine learning designer, on \"An Internet without A**holes,\" a panel that explored companies' responsibilities to cut down on harassment.  The panel's timing coincided with Twitter's rollout of new anti-harassment tools, which included an option for reporting hate speech.  Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) has been widely criticized for its failure to combat online harassment -- an issue that was particularly salient during the U.S. presidential election and illustrated by the millions of anti-Semitic tweets targeting journalists this year.  Sinders said Twitter's efforts to combat the issue are like trying to turn around the Titanic, noting the social behemoth can't flip a switch to solve widespread harmful activity. When Twitter builds anti-harassment tools, they must work across all platforms: iOS, Android, desktop, mobile web, and wherever tweets appear across the internet, Sinders said.  Social coding site GitHub has also experienced harassment problems, both internally and on its site. Leong's team is responsible for identifying issues and building tools to prevent further harassment, but there is no simple solution. She said creating a document outlining acceptable conduct on GitHub was a 19 month-long project.  \"It took a really long time to get to a consensus about what harassment looks like, but that's one of the main things [companies] have to do,\" Leong added.  Definitions and codes of conduct vary by site: GitHub is a productivity tool that programmers use to do their jobs, while Twitter is a sharing platform. So GitHub's standards for acceptable content will be different than Twitter's practices.  Related: Strangers trolling you on social media are on the rise  Leong emphasized the people making those decisions should represent the diversity of people using the products, and that will provide holistic feedback about how users may abuse others. At GitHub, the community and safety team is half women of color and 30% transwomen -- far more diverse than most companies in Silicon Valley. An average business in the area is disproportionately white and male.  Establishing a definition of harassment and inappropriate behavior is crucial to anti-harassment efforts, and companies should think about how people could mistreat tools or systems throughout the creation process, Sinders said.  When building new features, it's important for Twitter, Facebook and other social companies to think through every possible scenario; not just how people will use it as intended but how it could be abused, she added.  While tools exist to police speech, quelling mean or argumentative behavior entirely isn't necessarily the ideal solution, Sinders stressed.  \"I am really hesitant to say you can code out dickishness. Because who gets to decide those parameters and how do we make sure those parameters are ethical?\" Sinders told CNNMoney. \"I do think that if I want to leave a conversation, there should be a tool to let me do that.\" ", "date": "November 16, 2016: 12:27 PM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/16/technology/internet-without-jerks/index.html", "author": "Selena Larson"},

The company announced plans on Thursday for a new 'Community Help' feature that will help people lean on their network in times of need.  The feature, slated to roll out in early 2017, will pair with the company's Safety Check tool.  Safety Check, which has been activated 39 times by the social network since its 2014 launch, enables people to quickly notify friends and family that they're safe in a crisis situation, like a natural disaster or terror attack. By selecting \"I'm Safe,\" Facebook (FB, Tech30) sends an automatic notification to their network.  Community Help takes that one step further by allowing people to ask for or offer help to others, from providing food and water to transportation and shelter. The Help feature is a new kind of marketplace.  Related: Facebook admits it messed up more ad metrics  In the wake of tragedies, people have created hashtags as a way to source housing. For example, the hashtag #PortesOuvertesNice -- which means \"open doors\" -- surfaced online following the attack in Nice, France on Bastille Day.  Naomi Gleit -- VP of social good -- also announced at its Social Good Forum in New York City that the company is turning over its Safety Check feature entirely to the community.  In June, it rolled out a community-triggered feature that automatically activates Safety Check once a lot of people in a certain region post about a crisis situation. This is usually verified by a third-party organization that confirms an issue in the area.  Since then, the community has activated it 335 times, including the Pulse Nightclub attack in Orlando, Florida and the Chelsea neighborhood bombings in New York City.

Chudnovsky cited these early numbers as \"signs that the platform is starting to work.\"  Facebook launched Bots for Messenger a month ago at F8, its annual developer's conference.

{"text": "Say hello to the Internet of Filthy Things. Tech companies are turning their attention to the world of dumpsters, garbage trucks and landfills.  With smart trash cans, professional dumpster divers and mounds of waste data, these companies are able to make a dirty business more efficient. Cities and companies are saving millions.  Traditionally, trash is picked up on a regular schedule, regardless of whether a dumpster is full or not. Enevo, a Finnish company, retrofits trash bins with sensors to detect how full the container is, and when it is emptied. This way a business will only have its trash removed when needed, and it can verify a pick-up has happened.  \"We're trying to be a fresh wind and provide transparency in the value chain,\" said Fredrik Kekalainen, Enevo's founder and CEO, whose previous company made software for mobile phones. Now his technology skills are helping to shake up the waste industry. Enevo doesn't actually make garbage trucks or dumpsters, but provides the software and sensors to optimize them.   According to Kekalainen, it's common to empty dumpsters when they're only 30% to 60% full. Enevo's technology means trash trucks waste fewer miles driving around cities.  After tracking the garbage trucks in Antwerp, Belgium, Enevo halved the numbers of trucks needed in the city. Rotterdam, another Enevo customer, learned it could cut the days it picked up trash by 20%.  Smart dumpsters also empower homes, buildings and businesses to track exactly how much trash they generate. While utilities tell us how many gallons of water we use, and how many watts of electricity, the same isn't done for trash. Kekalainen said this will ultimately help governments and businesses change behavior and limit waste.  Related: The $100,000 job: Garbage workers  Rubicon Global is another standout in the burgeoning smart trash sector.  In a sense, Rubicon Global is the Uber of the trash world. It connects independent garbage truck operators with specific jobs. Customers can request a pick-up exactly when they need it. Rubicon Global gives drivers recommended routes to improve their efficiency.  CEO Nate Morris said his company's secret sauce is its data, technology and ability to incentivize businesses to not put trash in landfills.  Revenue has tripled this year. It operates in all 50 U.S. states.  The Atlanta-based company puts a smartphone in garbage trucks. It can tell when a dumpster has been emptied by listening for the sounds of a truck's hydraulic arms, the clang of a dumpster's lids closing, and the vibrations of the truck as it's filled with trash.  Customers get regular reports of when their trash is picked up and how much waste they're generating.  Some employees, jokingly called professional dumpster divers, will assess a business's trash output and offer suggestions on how to improve it.  According to chief technology officer Phil Rodoni, Rubicon Global helped one large retailer turn its trash bill into a profitable business. Rubicon suggested the retailer take the cardboard boxes that merchandise arrived in and return them to its distribution centers. Then the cardboard could be sold to a paper mill.  Businesses such as Rubicon Global and Enevo help the environment, but without increasing costs for companies. It seems like an idea everyone can agree on.  \"I don't think anyone is pro-landfill or pro-garbage,\" Morris said.

It will be Jaguar's first electric vehicle and only its second SUV ever.  The all-wheel-drive I-Pace should have an EPA-estimated driving range of 220 miles, according to Jaguar Land Rover, which makes Jaguar cars.  The crossover SUV was unveiled in an international press conference that included a virtual reality presentation. While reporters in both London and Los Angeles were able to see a computer-drawn virtual reality presentation, those in L.A. were presented with an actual concept vehicle driven out onto the floor among them.  The I-Pace has what car designers call a \"cab-forward\" design with a short hood, possible because the nose of the car does not need to house a large engine. That shape allows for better aerodynamics and more interior space.   \"I was determined from the very beginning of the project to create a design that reflected the mechanics of the car,\" Jaguar design director Ian Callum said in a statement.  The vehicle's wheels are also farther out, closer to the ends of the SUV, a factor that helps improve a vehicle's driving performance. This was also dictated by the requirements of the car's large, flat battery pack, said Callum.   Electric motors mounted in the front and back of the SUV produce a combined 400 horsepower and 516 foot-pounds of torque, a measure of raw pulling power.  Jaguar only recently introduced its first SUV model, the Jaguar F-Pace, which has been a sales success for the brand. It became Jaguar's largest selling model shortly after going on sale.

Kraft is behind @EveryTrumpDonor, as well as two other politically oriented Twitter bots, @EveryDemDonor and @EveryGOPDonor.

{"text": "The next six months could define the future of Nintendo. The 127 year-old company is attempting to straddle two paths: Making games for smartphones, while continuing to sell dedicated gaming systems.  In December, the company will release of Super Mario Run for iOS, marking the first time Nintendo's mascot will appear in a game for smartphones.  But the introduction of its latest console, Nintendo Switch -- a tablet that slides into a dock to display games on TV -- will be one of the biggest moments for the company in recent years.  Related: Nintendo Switch console looks like the future of gaming  Consumers cheered the unveiling of Nintendo Switch last week, calling the console innovative and a potential game changer. But investors weren't impressed: shares slid 6.6% in Tokyo the next day.  The device, due out in March, is a handheld system that can easily transform into a console for the home.   \"Switch, while it looks interesting, could imply smartphone games are not as much of a priority now,\" explains David Gibson, a senior analyst at Macquarie Securities in Tokyo. \"The reason why the share price is where it is isn't because of Switch -- it's because of smartphone games.\"  Analysts have long called for Nintendo (NTDOF) to abandon building its own hardware and focus on developing software for smartphones. After holding out for years, the company finally said in 2015 that it will produce smartphone games but it was also working on its next dedicated gaming system.  \"Nintendo is a very proud, very old, very conservative Japanese company,\" says Serkan Toto, CEO of Japanese consultancy Kantan Games. \"I think it will take a sea change at Nintendo for the company to exit the dedicated video game business.\"  Once dominant, Nintendo's fortunes have fluctuated wildly over the last decade, from the surprising mainstream success of the Wii to the quiet failure of its successor, the Wii U.  The Wii U has sold just 13 million units, a fraction of the more than 100 million clocked up by the original Wii.  One of the factors behind the Wii U's struggles was Nintendo's inability to release enough games on a regular basis. There were also long gaps between major software releases on Wii U. The company later admitted it had trouble producing software for both its home console and handheld console, the 3DS.  Nintendo found it difficult to shift resources or port games between the 3DS and Wii U -- two very different systems.   In response, Nintendo combined their portable and home console game development teams in 2013. CEO Satoru Iwata told investors the following year that the company's next systems would share a common platform to make building games easier.  In hindsight, it's clear the company was preparing for Nintendo Switch. Producing a steady stream of games for Switch will be vital because no company in the gaming industry leans on their own lineup like Nintendo.  Despite traditionally weak third-party support, the fact Nintendo games -- such as Mario, Zelda, Pok\u00e9mon and Wii Sports -- are so strong is one of the main reasons people buy Nintendo systems.  But analysts seem to agree Nintendo can't survive without support: \"Third parties are important because it gives you a variety of content,\" says Gibson.  \"Having only one developer for a system, even if it's Nintendo ... is not enough,\" says Toto. \"You need to have third party developer support for people who don't like Mario.\"  If Nintendo Switch fails, Toto thinks the company could still have a bright future in smartphone games.  \"Once the management at Nintendo takes mobile more seriously, I personally believe that Nintendo would mop the floor with everybody else,\" he says.

{"text": "Mercy Hospital wants to provide better care for its patients -- by making sure they don't come to the hospital. Instead, 330 staffers at Mercy's Virtual Care Center, located just outside of St. Louis, place video calls to patients using highly sensitive two-way cameras -- and monitor their vital signs in real time through tools like pulse oximeters that plug into an iPad.  The goal: Avoid expense and hassle on both sides by providing care when and where the patient needs it, preventing some of the hospital re-admissions that add $41.3 billion to hospital costs annually, according to a government study.  Under new federal guidelines, hospitals are partly responsible for keeping costs down. So they're turning to video chats, email and other online communications to keep patients out of the ER whenever possible.  \"The sickest 5% of patients are typically responsible for about half of the health care spent and many end up, unnecessarily, back in the hospital,\" Gavin Helton, the medical director of Mercy Virtual Care, told CNNMoney. \"We need an answer for those patients.\"  Mercy says the Virtual Care Center, launched in October 2015, is the first of its kind: a $54 million, four-story \"hospital without beds\" that houses zero patients. It's home to a variety of \"telemedicine\" programs that allow Mercy to care for patients remotely round-the-clock.  Caring for an 80-year-old stroke victim  A new Mercy Virtual pilot program is focused on remote care for patients in their homes. The initial pilot includes 250 patients with complex chronic illnesses.  One of those patients is Leroy Strubberg, 80, who suffers from cardiac issues and is recovering from three mini-strokes.  \"When I was a kid, when you were sick the doctor came to your house,\" Strubberg told CNNMoney.  Times have changed, and Strubberg lives on a cattle farm in New Haven, Missouri, more than an hour away from Mercy St. Louis. So Mercy enrolled Strubberg in the in-home care program. He now talks with Mercy Virtual Care staffers, called \"navigators,\" twice a week.  The navigators video-call Strubberg on his hospital-supplied iPad and ask the same questions they would during an in-office visit: How are you feeling? Have you been taking your medicine? What hurts? The navigators also direct Ruth Ann, Strubberg's wife of 59 years, to use equipment like a blood pressure cuff that connects to the iPad.  Strubberg credits the program with keeping him out of the hospital twice in the past few months.  \"Once, I felt like I was maybe having congestive heart failure because I couldn't breathe; my lungs were filling up,\" Strubberg told CNNMoney. His main Mercy navigator, Dan Milner, assessed his vital signs remotely and determined he wasn't having a heart episode. He simply needed a new medication.  Then, just last month, Strubberg suffered a bad fall while using his walker. Strubberg's left side began to bruise immediately. His ribs ached; he could barely breathe.   Ruth Ann was ready to call an ambulance, but instead the Strubbergs called Mercy Virtual Care. Milner inspected the bruising on the video call and directed Strubberg to try a variety of movements. Milner concluded Strubberg hadn't broken any ribs and sent recommendations for care at home.  Building trust via an iPad  To make programs like Mercy Virtual work, navigators must do \"a lot of thinking outside the box,\" Milner told CNNMoney.  \"You have to break that whole clinic kind of thinking with nursing: 'Oh my gosh, he needs to go to the ER,\" Milner said. \"[There's] an antiquated idea of how people think healthcare should be.\"  But not all patients welcome that kind of disruption. Milner recalled a 99-year-old woman who became so overwhelmed and upset by the technology that \"we told her to take the iPad and put it in a drawer,\" he said. For that patient, Milner now conducts sessions over the phone and has a family member take and report her vital signs.  \"There's struggles in every single step of the process,\" said Megan Donovan, another Mercy navigator. For example: It might take a patient 15 minutes to find the power button to turn on their iPad, she said.  Related: This deaf-blind lawyer thinks your app needs work  That unfamiliarity can be a huge hurdle, said Gavin Helton, the Mercy Virtual medical director: \"Many of these patients have never held a tablet before. For them, that's scarier than getting their chest cracked open.\"  Beyond helping patients get comfortable with the hardware itself, it's key for navigators to build trust, Donovan said.  \"It's harder to trust someone when you've actually never met them,\" she said. \"We really have to spend a lot of time to getting to know them. I know their family members, I know what they do for fun. I know what their dogs are named. You have to really make them feel comfortable with you.\"  Related: How Google designs for the blind  Not everyone believes virtual-care technology has a place in health care, however. Critics of telemedicine are concerned about \"continuity of care,\" saying that patients may receive care from different navigators each time they call, and primary care doctors may be looped out of important health discussions.  Mercy says it works closely with patients' primary care physicians and tries to keep people with the same navigator as much as possible. (Strubberg said he sees his main navigator Milner \"90% of the time.\")  Working through the challenges is well worth it, Helton said, given the opportunity that virtual care represents. Mercy credits the Virtual Care program with a more than 33% decrease in emergency room visits and hospitalizations since last year's launch.  Doctors have \"come full-circle\" back to the days of house calls, Helton said, albeit with a modern twist.  \"As opposed to bringing the little black bag into the home, we have tablets, we have biometric sensors, we have triage software,\" Helton said. \"But we're still providing that personal touch.

{"text": "Facebook's year just went from bad to worse. Facebook (FB, Tech30) admitted Wednesday it messed up more ad metrics than previously thought, potentially eroding its trust and relationship with marketers and publishers.  The social network said in a blog post it miscalculated the number of completed video views, the total organic reach for business Pages and the amount of time spent with Instant Articles.  In some cases, the metrics were significantly overstated.  The average time spent on Instant Articles -- Facebook's faster alternative for consuming news on the platform -- was \"over-reported\" by 7% - 8% since August, 2015. The reason: Facebook didn't do the appropriate basic math of dividing time spent by total views.  The company also overestimated the number of people businesses reached with unpaid posts on their Facebook Pages during the preceding week and month because it forgot to \"de-duplicate repeat visitors.\" In other words, it double counted.  In September, Facebook apologized for miscalculating the average time users spend watching videos, saying the number was \"overstated.\"  Related: Uncertainty over Trump pushes tech stocks into the red  Top execs from Facebook went on an unofficial apology tour soon after at Advertising Week in New York to ease concerns and make it clear the error did not impact dollars spent on marketing.  Facebook echoed that point in its recent blog post: \"We do not bill clients on the potential under-reporting/over-reporting metric issues mentioned.\"  Nonetheless, Facebook may face renewed concerns about whether it can be trusted to do simple math and measure itself.  \"They do say 'trust us' a lot,\" says Ian Schafer, CEO of Deep Focus, a digital agency. \"People trust Facebook because they are the only ones that have access to all of that data and they alone can tell people what the correct thing do is on the platform.\"  If the data can't be trusted, however, Schafer says that \"faith in Facebook... is going to erode.\"  \"I'm an advertiser and I'm questioning what other data is incorrect,\" he adds  The company is now looking to preempt those concerns by promising to look at \"additional third-party reviews\" that can vet its metrics, as well as partnering with Nielsen for video view counts.  Facebook is also planning to communicate more with its media partners about updates to its various metrics.  The latest admission of error comes at a time when Facebook is already under fire for enabling potentially discriminatory ads, It also faces concerns that rampant fake news on the social network could have influenced the presidential election.  Facebook's stock, already down in the days following Donald Trump's victory, dipped about 1% in early trading.

{"text": "The humiliation keeps on coming for Samsung. The world's biggest smartphone maker has become the butt of jokes on U.S. comedy shows and social media because its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone has shown a tendency to burst into flames.  \"That really gives new meaning to 'My phone is blowing up,'\" quipped Stephen Colbert on the Late Show last month.  Samsung's failure to effectively deal with the weeks-long crisis -- promising that replacement Note 7 phones were safe only for them to start catching fire, too -- has eroded trust in one of the world's top tech brands.   The South Korean company moved to try to prevent contamination of its other smartphone models by announcing Tuesday that it was giving up on the Note 7 altogether. But it still hasn't explained why some of the devices kept exploding.  \"Honesty and transparency are needed to repair the damage to its brand image,\" said TuanAnh Nguyen, a research analyst at Canalys. \"Failure to do so will create long-lasting repercussions on its other product lines.\"  Related: Samsung takes $10 billion hit to end Galaxy Note 7 fiasco  In the meantime, people are going to keep mocking Samsung and the Note 7 on social media. Posts in recent weeks have included pictures of the phone in an ice bucket, being handled by a guy in a bomb-disposal suit and being tossed like a grenade.   Users have also ridiculed Samsung's handling of the crisis, which is already costing the company billions of dollars. And the company's cause isn't helped by reports that one of its washing machines can explode.   Some experts say Samsung (SSNLF) hasn't been communicating well with its customers.  \"The way Samsung handled PR has been very confusing for people,\" said Bryan Ma, vice president of device research at IDC. \"They said they care about the consumers, but it was addressed in a very corporate manner. Samsung really needs to show they care about consumers and needs to put a human face behind it, like the way Tim Cook apologized when Apple had issues.\"  Samsung has some previous experience of coming clean about its shortcomings.  Back in 1995, Chairman Lee Kun-hee ordered the mass burning of products he deemed low grade and defective, ramming home the message of quality first. A similar message may be needed now -- although perhaps without the fires.  Related: U.S. warns Samsung washing machine owners after explosion reports  This year, Samsung's brand was ranked as the 11th most valuable in the world by Forbes. It's South Korea's most renowned company, and some Korean customers say they will keep buying its phones out of loyalty, despite the Note 7's failings.  The bigger challenge for Samsung is to convince consumers around the world that it can still be trusted after replacing a potentially dangerous phone with another potentially dangerous phone.  Related: Loyalists stick with Galaxy Note 7 to the bitter end  It will get a chance to do so with the next model in its S series, which is expected to be released in early 2017. Experts warn that Samsung should prioritize reliability over flashy features, which the Note 7 had in abundance.  Nguyen says he expects the new phone \"will be met with extreme scrutiny, and sales will be slow initially until Samsung can prove that it is safe to use.\"  -- K.J. Kwon contributed to this report.

Celebrities like Chrissy Teigen and Kylie Jenner have been vocal about how they're taking advantage of new Instagram tools to filter unwanted comments. Teigen even shared a photo on Twitter to illustrate the types of words she's filtering out.  But not everyone has that option -- at least not yet. While Instagram announced new features over the weekend, they're only available to those with \"high volume\" comment threads, meaning average users are out of luck.  Despite the attention the issue has received recently -- and that fact that platforms like Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30) have pledged to do better, internet trolls are on the rise.  According to a new poll of more than 1,000 Internet users, vitriol and threats from online strangers is worse now than in 2014, the last time the study was conducted.  The poll was commissioned by Craig Newmark, founder of Craigslist and craigconnects, Rad Campaign, and Lincoln Park Strategies.  Related: Twitter permanently removes Milo Yiannopoulos from its platform  \"We need to understand the problem in order to start dealing with it,\" Newmark said in an e-mail to CNNMoney.  He founded craigconnects in 2011 to unite organizations that give voice to the less powerful, including veterans and women in tech.  Newmark added that he is troubled by the fact that online harassment has become a new kind of \"normal.\"  What's notable in this study is that more people said they knew their harasser than those who didn't. This debunks the common belief that online harassment is always anonymous: 61% of respondents said they know their harassers.  Facebook continues to be named as the platform where the most harassment takes place, with 63% reporting harassment on the social networking site. That far dwarfs harassment on other platforms.  Related: Muslim women deluged by 'hate tweets'   The poll found that women, minorities, millennials and Democrats experience the most harassment.  \"Political harassment has gone up,\" said Allyson Kapin, cofounder of Rad Campaign, adding that sexual harassment has declined. \"It's definitely reflective of the presidential election.\"  Newmark and Kapin said that while some of the social networks have started using things like algorithms and reporting tools to filter harassment, there's still a lot of work to do.  \"We've got to do better,\" wrote Newmark.  Kapin added that filtering out certain words, which is the feature Instagram rolled out, only puts \"bandaids\" on the issue.  \"The problem will be solved slowly, requiring new law and technology yet to be developed,\" added Newmark.

Those who haven't seen or heard from family and friends in the area are desperately posting photos and descriptions in the hopes of crowdsourcing any information about them.

{"text": "Your interactions with Facebook just got a bit more human. At F8, its annual developers conference, the company announced Bots for Messenger. Users will be able to get everything from weather updates to shopping notifications to personalized news from a range of companies including CNN -- all through Facebook's messaging app.  People will now be able to message companies and publishers like they would message their friends.  \"A lot of people are thinking about bots in a geeky way -- we'd like to think of bots in a different way,\" Facebook's VP of messaging products David Marcus told CNNMoney.  But Marcus paints a picture of a world where your boarding pass is available in one tap on Facebook Messenger. It's the same place you can book a table at your favorite restaurant, print a photo and find a ride.  Bots for Messenger is launching with a few dozen partners, including HP, shopping app Spring and CNN.  HP (HPQ) built a tool that lets users print a photo by sending it to the company's printing bot on Messenger. Once a user sends a photo, the bot responds conversationally (i.e. \"Hey, nice photo,\") and gives printing options. Users can connect to their personal printers or send photos to locations around the world, HP Innovation Manager David Parry told CNNMoney, adding that bots are still in their early stages.  \"[Eventually, bots will be] able to handle very administrative tasks in a very easy way -- reservations, hotels, banking -- as AI is able to anticipate needs and proactively talk to you, it'll get more exciting,\" he said.  Related: Facebook made its own Siri: Meet M  Through CNN's bot, users can message topics like \"zika virus\" or \"politics\" and CNN will respond with related stories and information on the topic.  There's an \"Ask CNN\" feature where you can ask questions like, \"What's the latest on the 2016 election?\" It will also feature a \"stories for you\" tab based on what you've clicked on in the past. Over time, the bot will get to know you better and serve you more personalized stories.  CNN's chatbot responses will be conversational, Samantha Barry, head of social media at CNN, said.  \"You'll see that we are using a lot of personal pronouns 'I, me, you' because it's fitting with the messaging space.\"  \"A personal news experience is all about context -- from the person's location to the time of day to the stories that matter most,\" said CNN's Chief Product Officer Alex Wellen.  Related: Facebook takes live video to the next level  This is the start of CNN's play into messaging, he said, adding that the company is exploring ways to enable chats on voice-activated technologies like Alexa, Siri and Watson.  Spring is another early tester of Bots for Messenger, with its Personal Shopper bot. It will serve up personalized suggestions based on your shopping preferences and send a confirmation when users make purchases on Spring. The bot will ask you a set of questions -- from what items you're interested in to your price range -- and then serve up suggestions.  Companies like Slack and WeChat are already utilizing bots. With 900 million monthly users on Messenger, Facebook will be able to cast a wide net. Its developer conference has historically been a venue for Facebook to unveil new features, from the \"Like\" button to Facebook Connect.  Success will depend on the quality of Facebook's conversational bots -- and whether customers use them.  Related: Facebook, Microsoft say they pay women, men equally  Microsoft's attempt to create a teenage chatbot went awry after it started spewing racist comments on Twitter. Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) was forced to shut it down.  Marcus said the types of bots built for Messenger will be fundamentally different than Microsoft's bot, nicknamed \"Tay.\"  \"The goal of Tay was to build a conversational AI as an experiment,\" he said. Facebook's bots have a more clearly defined purpose -- all designed to simplify your life in some way. \"It's almost like an app within a thread,\" he explained.  Marcus said there will also be a process for bot approval and monitoring to ensure users have a good experience.  Facebook (FB, Tech30) is calling on developers to build bots for thousands of additional businesses, brands and publishers so they can directly connect with Facebook's users.  \"It's a new era,\" Marcus said. \"A lot of companies can be built around this opportunity.\"  ", "date": "April 12, 2016: 6:08 PM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/12/technology/facebook-messenger-bots/index.html", "author": "Laurie Segall"},
{"text": "What's this? The window for initial public offerings might finally be open again. It was starting to look like it was permanently nailed shut. Twilio, a text messaging tech company, surged more than 90% on its first day of trading last week.  And the stock has continued to fly high -- despite volatility in the broader market due to Brexit worries. Twilio was up nearly 20% Wednesday, and is now 140% above its initial offering price.  This could be great news for unicorns -- the term used for private companies with a market valuation of at least $1 billion. Twilio is one. It was valued at about $1.2 billion before the IPO and is now worth more than $2.8 billion.  So will the successful debut of Twilio, a company that is posting strong revenue growth, but is still not profitable, lead to a broader comeback for IPOs?  Twilio is sort of the anti-Square (SQ), so far. The mobile payments startup, run by Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) CEO Jack Dorsey, had a weak debut last year and is still trading only barely above its offering price.  Related: Snapchat could soon be valued at more than $20 billion  That led to many experts wondering if the age of the unicorn was over. A dismal first quarter for IPOs had people worrying even more about the bubble bursting for startups. The collapse of British unicorn Powa didn't help either.  But worries about unicorns going extinct may have been premature.  Investors will have another chance to see just how strong the market's appetite for hot startups will be when Line, a Japanese social media messaging app that competes with Facebook (FB, Tech30)-owned WhatsApp, goes public in New York and Tokyo.  Line, owned by South Korean tech company Naver, is hoping to raise more than $1 billion from the stock sale. At the upper end of its initial price range, the company could be worth about $6.5 billion.  So far, none of the biggest unicorns (some of have dubbed them decacorns because they are valued at more than $10 billion) have filed to go public.  \"With many of the unicorns, there is an accelerated interest in going public sooner rather than later,\" said Jared Carmel, managing partner with Manhattan Venture Partners. \"We're hearing that more have decided to talk to underwriters.\"  Carmel added that he would not be surprised if some of the largest unicorns filed for IPOs after the U.S. presidential election, with the hopes of going public in 2017.  Related: Uber's big Chinese rival just raised more than $7 billion  And if Twilio continues to impress Wall Street and Line has a solid offering, then it may be time for bigger startups like Uber, China's Apple (AAPL, Tech30) rival Xiaomi, Airbnb, Snapchat and big data firm Palantir to go public too. (CNN has a partnership with Snapchat.)  Heck, Palantir was name-dropped on one of the final episodes of the TV show \"Person Of Interest\" earlier this month -- and in the same sentence as Facebook and Google (GOOGL, Tech30), no less.  If unicorns are getting a mention on stodgy CBS (CBS) -- a TV network that tends to skew to an older demographic -- then maybe IPOs really are back in the mainstream.

{"text": "Harassment is the thorn in Twitter's side. It has stymied the platform's growth and continues to frustrate users. To step up enforcement of hate speech, the company announced a new reporting tool and an improved mute feature on Tuesday.  Twitter has played whack-a-mole with harassment for years, trying to balance free speech while determining exactly what line tweets shouldn't cross. Over the years, it's slowly improved reporting tools, and in February, the company established a council to advise Twitter on how to handle harassment.  Yet the company routinely fails to address ongoing harassment that very obviously threatens people.  Hate speech has always been against Twitter's rules, and people could report it for themselves or for other accounts. The new option will allow users to report hateful content separately and is meant to make it easier to report hate speech to Twitter.  Last year, the company updated its policies to define hate speech, noting that language meant to \"harass, intimidate, or use fear to silence another user's voice\" is not allowed on the platform.  \"Our hope is that by creating this option it will not only make it clearer to people that they can report this kind of content, but also make it clearer why they are reporting certain types of content,\" Del Harvey, Twitter's vice president of trust and safety, told CNNMoney.  Related: Journalists face rise in anti-Semitic tweets, fueled by Trump supporters  The new feature appears as a button in the reporting flow. Instead of saying something is \"abusive or harassing,\" it lets you mark tweets as hateful. Harvey said the new tool will improve how Twitter deals with reports from those who are not involved in the incident of harassment.  Because hate speech varies in language, culture and context, Twitter trained its global support teams about its historical and cultural implications of it. For instance, Twitter employees learned common tropes and phrases associated with anti-Semitism, and slang terms that are used to reference refugees or migrants, Harvey said.  Anyone at Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) who works on safety issues or handles support completed the training. Twitter declined to give exact numbers on how many people deal with harassment reports, but a spokeswoman said there are people working on it around the clock. Humans review each issue and decide whether or not it's abusive.  Zuckerberg: Idea that fake news influenced election is 'crazy'  Twitter activity during the 2016 U.S. presidential election is an unfortunate example of the overwhelming hate speech spewed on the platform. Anti-Semitic Twitter attacks increased drastically as millions of tweets targeted journalists in particular.  Screenshots shared frequently on its own platform demonstrate how Twitter fails to recognize abusive and harmful language as harassment, and even high-profile celebrities have left or taken breaks from the service.  To give users more control over the content they see, Twitter is expanding its mute feature to let people filter out words and phrases they don't want to see in their mentions. Over time, the company will expand it anywhere you see tweets, like on your timeline or in searches. Twitter launched the original mute feature -- which lets you mute accounts without blocking them -- in 2014.  The new features are part of an ongoing effort to curb harassment. The company knows it still has considerable work to do to make Twitter better.  \"Every single that thing we do is going to be a work in progress,\" Harvey said. \"Our reporting system is going to continue changing, we're going to continue iterating on it, continue making improvements to it.\" ", "date": "November 15, 2016: 9:02 AM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/15/technology/twitter-harassment/", "author": "Selena Larson"},
{"text": "When Noel Molina smells trash, he smells money. Lots of it. Molina and his co-worker, Tony Sankar, have been picking trash together for a decade in New York City.  They've seen, and smelled, it all. Stale fish, footlong rats, dead pigs and cows. Countless drunks have heckled them. And yes, one time Sankar saw a human leg in a dumpster.  They work the graveyard shift -- 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. -- rain or shine, ice cold or burning hot.  And yet, they love their job. Part of the reason is they get paid well for their hard work.  \"Your trash is my money,\" Molina, 32, says with a baby-faced grin.  Molina made $112,000 last year as a garbage truck driver and Sankar made $100,000 as a helper, riding on the back of the truck. Their wages have grown in eight of the last nine years, according to their bosses, brothers David and Jerry Antonacci, owners of Crown Container, a waste management company.  Related: Workers' rage over move to Mexico caught on video  Molina dropped out of high school in the 10th grade and he's worked at Crown for 10 years. He says his starting salary was about $80,000. Sankar too dropped out of school before migrating to the U.S. from Guyana 20 years ago.  Not everyone makes six figures, but most trash workers are doing better than high school dropouts and even graduates.  Nationwide, the annual salary for a garbage truck driver is $40,000, according to the Labor Department. Across all professions, high school dropouts earn about $24,000, while high school graduates make $30,000 annually, according to the U.S. Education Department.  Molina and Sankar are aware that they outearn many people with a college degree.  Guys who go to college might not make the kind of money \"(I make) on the back of a garbage truck, picking up trash,\" says Sankar.   Related: The $100k job: Be an apprentice  Not only do they earn a good salary, their wages are growing faster than the average too. Nationwide, wages for trash workers have grown 18%, which is a lot faster than the 14% average for all workers since the recession ended in June 2009.  That's because it's not easy to find workers in the business. Employers can't find qualified truck drivers, landfill operators or mechanics.  David Antonacci says he got 50 applications when he advertised for a truck driver's job. Only four applicants had a commercial drivers license and all four had penalties on their licenses. So Antonacci couldn't hire any of them.  Related: Yelp CEO responds to employee letter on low wages  That lack of available talent is one key reason why Antonacci and others in the industry have given out raises at a faster pace than the national average.  It's the same story in other parts of the country. Kathy Morris runs a waste management facility in Davenport, Iowa, and she's raised wages to retain employees.  \"Not only has the demand for workers increased but (so have) the types of skills,\" says Morris, director of the Waste Commission of Scott County. The landfill operators at her site make about $50,000 a year.   Related: British oil industry warns it may collapse  It's far from an easy job. Beyond the stench, Molina and Sankar lift heavy trash bags every night, weave through traffic, and talk to each other constantly for safety. They work a lot too -- 55 to 60 hours a week.  Outside of physically grueling work, negative stigmas deter young adults from applying even though the barrier for entry isn't high: private trash companies don't require a high school diploma. Truck drivers need a commercial drivers license, which some employers will train employees for.  But there's job security, says David Biderman, executive director of Solid Waste Association of North America, the association that represents thousands of waste management workers.  Biderman argues the waste industry offers long-term job security for working class folks. Both Molina and Sankar have full health care coverage and a 401(k) retirement account. If they leave the job, they are entitled to severance pay too.  Related: Why you should worry about cheap oil   \"We're one of the very few blue collar jobs that can't be outsourced to China,\" he says.  There are also new opportunities in trash. New types of recycling have created more jobs. At Morris' site in Iowa, she has a crew that only separate recycling for wood, roof shingles, kitchen appliances and electronics.  Morris has 45 employees now, up from 35 in 2009. Morris plans to hire six more people this year to handle a new recycling system.  Nationally, there are 50,000 more trash workers today than there were in 2010, according to Labor Department data.  Given the shortage of workers, some of them can hope to earn the six-figure salaries of Molina and Sankar, who are members of a labor union that helps negotiate higher salaries.

Sankar gave the young man the company's address and said to call. When told how much Sankar makes, the young man was in disbelief:  \"No, I wouldn't believe that.\"  Sankar picked up the last bag at the site, chucked it into the back, jumped onto the truck and smiled.  \"It's a good paying job,\" said Sankar, laughing into the winter night.

As lead engineer for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series for Team Chevrolet, Colon manages the technical resources GM provides all of its NASCAR Sprint Cup Race Teams. Colon and her team are constantly striving to innovate and improve things like the design bodies, engine parts and software to give them an edge on the track. She also serves as the main liaison between the teams and NASCAR.  And it's fair to state the obvious -- she's a double minority -- a Hispanic woman in a world traditionally full of white men. But take a walk through the garages with her and it's clear that she's not only earned their respect and her place but she is truly beloved.  Colon is now a champion several times over but, more importantly, she is a leader, which she knows comes with responsibility. She uses the platform to share her story in hopes of inspiring others. Colon speaks often at universities, Hispanic initiative events at GM, diversity programs hosted by NASCAR and, less formally, at elementary schools. It's here she hopes she can do the most good by reaching children young.  \"Many of these students, the examples they have at home is parents that didn't finish school,\" she said. \"So I want to show them hey, I am a Hispanic kid and I worked hard to get where I am.

Nintendo owns a stake in that too.  Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30) also owns a piece of Niantic. Google spun off Niantic last year following the company's Alphabet reorganization.

{"text": "Donald Trump doesn't have Silicon Valley in his corner. There are just 52 tech industry workers who have made political contributions to Trump, according to data from Crowdpac, which rates candidates based on things like speeches, voting records and campaign finance data.  It pulled data for CNNMoney on reported political contributions, including SuperPAC donations, from workers at some 200 tech companies.  These include firms like GE (GE) and Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), as well as startups like Uber and venture capital firms that invest in the tech sector. People report where they work, so while an Uber driver isn't technically an employee, if someone self identifies as \"Uber driver,\" Crowdpac counts them in the tech category.  The data reveals which tech companies have the most workers contributing to political campaigns and which presidential candidates are getting the most support from the tech industry.  Workers from Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30) (formerly Google) contributed the most to political campaigns, followed by VC firm Kleiner Perkins. (Kleiner Perkins' partner John Doerr contributed $500,000 to Priorities USA Action, a SuperPAC supporting Clinton.)  Bernie Sanders had by far the most donations from the tech industry -- $6 million from more than 33,000, according to Crowdpac. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, received $2.6 million from about 2,000 donors. Trump's 52 donors contributed just over $21,000.  Related: Who is Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel?  \"With any industry, the biggest thing they dislike is uncertainty. Trump is just a big, giant hurricane of uncertainty,\" said Reed Galen, a political strategist who has consulted with tech companies. \"You don't know what he'll say or do next. I'm not sure that he does, necessarily.\"  Trump has also rubbed some of tech's biggest leaders and executives the wrong way, from Apple's (AAPL, Tech30) Tim Cook to Amazon's (AMZN, Tech30) Jeff Bezos.  In February, Trump called for a boycott of all Apple products until the company turned its cellphone records over to authorities.  Trump \"has all the makings of an authoritarian leader,\" added Galen. \"If he believes you should do something, he believes you should do it because he wants it, whether or not you're happy about it.\"  Related: Trump says there's a tech bubble; Silicon Valley laughs it off  Moreover, Trump's remarks about African Americans, women, and Latinos and Muslims are in stark contrast to Silicon Valley's fight for a more inclusive industry.  \"The tech community has a consistent and ongoing problem -- both in perception and reality -- that it is still mostly a white male community,\" said Galen. \"[Trump's values] are not what they want to be seen as espousing or believing in.\"  Trump does have the support of one of Silicon Valley's biggest names: Peter Thiel, cofounder of PayPal (PYPL, Tech30) and Palantir. He's slated to be a Donald Trump delegate this summer. (Crowdpac data didn't turn up any contributions from Thiel.) But Thiel also been criticized for his beliefs and speech. (He once complained about women being granted the right to vote.)  While Trump doesn't have heavy financial support from the tech industry, there are other industries where he's \"performed much better\" said Mason Harrison, political director at Crowdpac. This includes finance and insurance, healthcare providers, and real estate. It's also important to note that Trump has largely self-funded his campaign.  Sanders has reported the most donations from tech industry workers -- but he also tends to report more donations because he includes donations of all sizes. Campaigns aren't required to go public with donor information for those who contribute less than $200. Sanders, however, uses a fundraising tool, ActBlue, which is legally required to show contributions of all sizes.  Crowdpac's data show that Clinton donors give a lot more on average than Sanders' supporters.

U.S. regulators on Wednesday warned owners of certain top-loading Samsung washing machines of \"safety issues\" following reports that some have exploded.  The warning, from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, covered machines made between March 2011 and April 2016. It did not specify a model.  The commission suggested people use only the delicate cycle to wash bedding and water-resistant and bulky items because the lower spin speed \"lessens the risk of impact injuries or property damage due to the washing machine becoming dislodged.\"  The agency said it is working with Samsung on a remedy.  Related: U.S. formally recalls Samsung Galaxy Note 7  The warning comes more than a month after Samsung was hit with a federal class-action lawsuit by customers who said their machines had exploded during use.   Customers in Texas, Georgia and Indiana all said they were washing clothes when they heard a violent boom.  A washer belonging to a McAllen, Texas, woman \"exploded with such ferocity that it penetrated the interior wall of her garage,\" according to court filings. A woman in Dallas, Georgia, said it felt and sounded as if \"a bomb went off.\"  The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New Jersey, references similar reports collected by local news and filed online with regulators. It also claims Samsung \"has moved aggressively to collect and destroy all evidence of the defective machines\" after they exploded.  \"We're very glad that CPSC is getting involved here,\" said Jason Lichtman, an attorney representing the plaintiffs. \"We think it's important that the scope of the problem be identified as quickly as possible.\"  Related: Samsung customer says his new Note 7 phone burst into flames  Samsung declined comment on the litigation. It directed CNNMoney to a statement on its website that says the company is talking to U.S. authorities about how to address potential safety problems.  \"In rare cases, affected units may experience abnormal vibrations that could pose a risk of personal injury or property damage when washing bedding, bulky or water-resistant items,\" the statement says.

The loss of one of its flagship smartphones is a major embarrassment for Samsung (SSNLF), which was forced to recall 2.5 million Note 7s shortly after the device went on sale in August.  The South Korean firm attempted to fix the problem by switching battery suppliers and updating the smartphone's software. Company executives issued a slew of apologies.  But when replacement phones were issued, a number of customers reported that those devices also caught fire, including one aboard a passenger jet.  Samsung on Monday advised all customers to stop using the phones, sending its shares tumbling by 8% in Seoul. The world's biggest smartphone maker said Tuesday it was killing off the phone entirely.  Related: The Galaxy Note 7 is a $10 billion problem for Samsung   The Note 7 was a premium device that sold for at least $850 in the United States. It received strong reviews from critics, who heralded it as sleek and powerful. But customer excitement soon evaporated as safety concerns grew.  Samsung was panned for its response to the crisis -- many customers were confused over whether their phone was safe, whether it should be returned and whether the electronics giant was offering a replacement.

{"text": "Samsung has killed off the Galaxy Note 7 in the hope of limiting the fallout from its exploding smartphone fiasco. The South Korean firm decided Tuesday to permanently halt sales and production of the Galaxy Note 7 just hours after telling customers to stop using all versions of the smartphone. Its stock plummeted 8% in Seoul, wiping about $17 billion off the company's market value.  The high-end phone was supposed to do battle with Apple's (AAPL, Tech30) iPhone 7, but instead ended up doing serious damage to Samsung's reputation.  Analysts say Samsung's (SSNLF) move to ditch the Note 7 entirely would be costly -- it could put a $9.5 billion dent in sales and erase $5 billion in profits, according to one estimate. But the risk of prolonging the agony was worse.  \"It's a painful move but perhaps not an entirely bad one in the grand scheme of things, as it helps isolate and contain the bad perception to that specific product rather than spreading fear that all Samsung phones might explode,\" said Bryan Ma, vice president of device research at IDC.  Related: Samsung tells users to turn off their Note 7 phones NOW  The credibility of the world's biggest smartphone maker was on the line after a series of missteps.  It was forced to recall about 2.5 million Note 7s in early September, just two weeks after the phone was launched, saying faulty batteries were causing some to burst into flames. It then started to issue replacement phones but a number of customers reported that those devices were also catching fire, including one aboard a passenger jet.   Samsung is now scrambling to limit the damage from one of the biggest smartphone recalls ever.  Identify the problem   Top priority will be to establish what exactly went wrong. The company initially blamed problems with a battery from one supplier. Experts say they believe a design flaw may have been responsible.  \"The discontinuation signals that the root of the problems does not lie in the production errors, but possibly in the product design,\" said TuanAnh Nguyen, a research analyst at Canalys.  Mark Newman, a Bernstein analyst who covers Samsung, said the battery explanation did not add up.  \"There appears to be something else at play,\" he said.   Come clean quickly  Once it's figured out the root cause, Samsung needs to be upfront with its customers. Otherwise the failure of the Note 7 could hurt sales of other Samsung phones and products.  \"Users are scared to use Samsung at all,\" Ma said. \"Samsung said they fixed it, but the problems keep happening.\"  Unless that impression can be corrected fast, the release of its next Galaxy S series model, which is expected early next year, could be tarnished.  \"Honesty and transparency is needed to repair the damage to its brand image,\" said Nguyen. \"Failure to do so will create long lasting repercussions on its other product lines,\" he added, suggesting the company may even have to drop the Note branding altogether.  Provide compensation  Samsung told customers in South Korea on Tuesday that they will be able to exchange their Note 7 for another smartphone. The exchange program will begin on Thursday and run through the end of the year.  It was not immediately clear what customers in other markets could expect in terms of a replacement or compensation.

{"text": "\"I hope you die slowly in a pool of pigs blood.\" \"Can I use that towel on your head to wipe my a**\"  These are just a couple of the cruel tweets that Laila Alawa, a 24-year-old entrepreneur, has had directed at her in the past week.  Alawa, who is Muslim, heads up a website called The Tempest that gives voice to millennial women of all ethnic backgrounds.  On Tuesday, she woke up to hundreds of \"hate tweets.\" The vitriol hasn't stopped since.  Alawa was the subject of an article on conservative website The Daily Caller, titled \"Syrian immigrant who said 9/11 'changed the world for good' is a homeland security advisor.\"  It used some of Alawa's tweets to support the claim, including one in which she wrote \"9/11 changed the world for good.\"  Alawa explained that she meant \"for good\" as in \"forever\" -- not \"for the good.\" The same tweet also read, \"I just hope we keep having open conversations about our differences.\"  Alawa, who is Syrian, was born in Denmark and lived in Japan for several years before immigrating to the United States as a child.  Related: Trolls target journalist after Melania Trump GQ article  The story came after the Department of Homeland Security released a report titled Countering Violent Extremism. Alawa was part of a subcommittee that helped brainstorm solutions for the report. She told CNNMoney that the subcommittee met about three times over a six month period and that she spent about 40 hours on it in total. Her name wasn't on the report itself, but her involvement can be found on other documentation online.  Alawa told CNNMoney it was \"terrifying\" to be painted as a \"radical Islamic terrorist.\" The sentiment was echoed in thousands of hateful tweets from online trolls responding to the Daily Caller's article, as well as articles in Breitbart and other blogs.  The tweets threaten her life and mock her looks and religion.  The Daily Caller's story came out shortly after the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando. 49 people were murdered in the country's worst terror attack since 9/11.  \"I understand that this is a really difficult political climate. People are afraid ... but it is entirely defamatory,\" said Alawa, who added that the Department of Homeland Security has done little to come to her defense.  \"Laila Alawa was selected as a subcommittee member because of her perspective as a Syrian American woman of the millennial generation,\" J. Todd Breasseale, assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS, wrote in an email to CNNMoney. \"[She] is not a member of the ... Homeland Security Advisory Council, as has been erroneously reported by some.\"  The Daily Caller stands by its story.  \"To be clear: Ms. Alawa never served on HSAC itself--only the Subcommittee on Combating Violent Extremism. My piece reflected that distinction,\" wrote reporter Peter Hasson in an email to CNNMoney. When asked about the backlash, Hasson wrote: \"I wholeheartedly condemn any harassment or threats.\"  But the article had no mention of Alawa's work as an entrepreneur or The Tempest's attempts to normalize what it means to be a woman perceived as an \"other.\"  \"I've grown up as a visible Muslim, with people spitting on me, yelling at me, harassing me,\" she said.  This attention is something she said she didn't expect to result from her involvement with the subcommittee, which she participated in because \"if you're not at the table, you're on the table.\"  Related: One tweet ruined her life  \"This has been really difficult,\" Alawa said of the online harassment. She said she's reported thousands of the tweets to Twitter and has been in touch with its safety team -- but less than a dozen have been taken down.  She said she's also notified the police, who came to her home in Washington, D.C. But the response to online harassment has been less than comforting.  \"[The police] didn't understand what 'doxxing' meant,\" she said, referring to a type of harassment where trolls use public platforms to dig up personal information and threaten someone's safety.  Alawa said the police failed to understand the gravity of the online threats, which is a frequent critique of law enforcement.  \"The law is about harassment in the physical world,\" Ari Ezra Waldman, an associate professor of law at New York Law School, told CNNMoney earlier this year. Law enforcement can see online threats as \"just words.\"  Alawa said that her name has been tarnished.  If you Google her name, these stories are the first that come up, which she fears could impact her company and its ability to raise funding from investors. Yet she refuses to make her Facebook and Twitter accounts private.  \"That just shows them that they've won and that they've silenced me,\" she said. \"That would be the ultimate loss for me.\" ", "date": "June 19, 2016: 7:54 PM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/19/technology/laila-alawa-trolling/index.html", "author": "Sara Ashley O'Brien"},

It has removed Milo Yiannopoulos, the widely-followed tech editor of conservative site Breitbart, from its platform.

{"text": "If you've found yourself blaming social media for electing Donald Trump, you're wrong. So says Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who was emphatic that his company was not responsible for influencing people's votes.  Fake news stories went viral about both candidates -- although there were far more lies about Hillary Clinton -- and the platform seemed to do to little to filter out inaccurate content. Now, people are wondering how much impact that content had on the outcome of the presidential election.  \"Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook -- of which it's a small amount of content -- influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,\" Zuckerberg said at the Techonomy conference Thursday.  But he didn't just try to absolve Facebook (FB, Tech30) -- he encouraged anyone criticizing the company to do some soul searching of their own.  \"I do think there is a profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone could've voted the way they did is fake news.\"  Related: Facebook shows you what you want to see post-election  His comments demonstrated a bit of a misunderstanding about how people use social media. A recent Pew study found that 20% of users have \"modified their stance on a social or political issue because of material they saw on social media.\"  This election cycle, some of the top fake news stories were shared millions of times on Facebook.  Already, Facebook's news feed creates filter bubbles -- its technology learns the kind of content you like and shows you more of it, pushing opposing opinions lower in your feed or not showing them to you at all.  Zuckerberg said Facebook's internal research suggests filter bubbles are not a problem, and that Facebook provides greater diversity of information than other media outlets. (Other research has suggested the opposite.)  Nearly two billion people use Facebook, and it's in the unique position of controlling what information, news, events, and interests those people see.  Zuckerberg gave no indication that Facebook was doing a post mortem on its role in the election except to say that the platform is always changing and \"it's not fully formed, and we'll keep improving it.\"  Related: The plague of fake news is getting worse  Other tech firms may also be going through a self-reckoning.  Twitch cofounder and tech investor Justin Kan told CNNMoney's Laurie Segall that companies should take a look at the role technology played in this election.  \"Have we created systems that bring us together to find common ground, or have we created systems that divide us?\" Kan said.  Twitter alums also reflected on the role Twitter played in the election. Software engineer Ben Matasar posed the question to his former colleagues: What did we build?  Responses to his tweet from former Twitter employees varied. Some called Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) a platform for positive connections, others a \"destroyer of worlds.\"  A significant social autopsy is required to understand the role technology, Facebook and the dissemination of fake news played in this election. But unless tech companies truly reckon with the power they have to wield information and influence beliefs, the bubbles we create for ourselves aren't likely to go away.

Lori Goler, Facebook's head of HR, said in a post Monday that Facebook reviews staff pay \"regularly\" -- and that the company has done so for \"many years.\"  \"We complete thorough statistical analyses to compare the compensation of men and women performing similar work,\" she wrote. \"I'm proud to share that at Facebook, men and women earn the same.\"  This is the first time that Facebook (FB, Tech30) has talked about its pay practices publicly. About 32% of Facebook's 12,000-plus global employees are female.  Microsoft's (MSFT, Tech30) gender pay gap report went into more detail, and said that women make about 99.8 cents for every dollar that a man makes. A year and a half ago, the gap was marginally larger -- 99.7 cents to a dollar.  \"I'm encouraged by these results,\" Kathleen Hogan, Microsoft's EVP of human resources wrote in a blog post. \"Our announcement today is another step forward along the path of greater diversity and inclusion progress at Microsoft, and in society as a whole.\"  Related: 'Wogrammer' tells positive stories about women in tech  Both of these reports follow a recent trend of pay disclosures from Silicon Valley firms eager to show progress on the tech and inequality problem.  GoDaddy (GDDY) said last year that its women employees get paid more than men do on the whole. But in tech roles, women made about 99 cents to the dollar when compared to their male counterparts, and 96 cents to a man's dollar at the executive level.  Apple (AAPL, Tech30) CEO Tim Cook said in February that female employees make 99.6 cents for every dollar that a man makes.  Salesforce (CRM, Tech30) announced last month that it spent nearly $3 million to correct \"statistically significant differences in pay.\" And CEO Marc Benioff told CNN's Poppy Harlow last year that he would look to hire enough women so that the company has an equal number of women and men.  Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) recently came out with the results of an employee survey which found that women made 99.9% of men's earnings in equivalent positions last year.  Related: U.S. gender pay gap is getting worse  Despite these announcements, a recent study shows that the pay disparity between men and women seems to be worsening in the United States.  The country now ranks 74th in wage equality among 145 countries, down from 65th place in 2014, according to the World Economic Forum's Global Gender report.  The gap between men and women's earnings widened to 64% from 66%.

{"text": "Facebook is cracking down on advertisers' ability to target and potentially discriminate against users by race. The move follows a wave of criticism in recent days. The social network plans to disable an option that let advertisers target or exclude users based on their \"ethnic affinity\" if those ads are for housing, employment or credit.  \"There are many non-discriminatory uses of our ethnic affinity solution in these areas, but we have decided that we can best guard against discrimination by suspending these types of ads\" Erin Egan, VP of U.S. public policy and chief privacy officer at Facebook, wrote in a blog post on Friday.  Facebook (FB, Tech30) came under fire late last month after a ProPublica report found the \"ethnic affinities\" option could be used to to discriminate against users in housing-related ads, which is forbidden under the Fair Housing Act.  Facebook does not actually ask users to identify their race. Instead, Facebook extrapolates the ethnic affinity of a user based on the content they like and their general activity on the platform.  Related: Mark Zuckerberg: The idea that fake news influenced the election is 'crazy'  This tool is one part of what makes Facebook so attractive to advertisers. Not only does the social network offer access to 1.79 billion users worldwide, it also provides advanced targeting options so advertisers can reach the most relevant of those users.  Christian Martinez, Facebook's head of multicultural, initially defended the advertising tool by noting that the company's ad policies \"strictly prohibit\" discriminatory advertising.  \"If we learn of advertising on our platform that involves this kind of discrimination, we will take aggressive enforcement action,\" Martinez wrote in October.  But that wasn't enough to ease concerns.  Several members of Congress signed a letter last week accusing Facebook of being \"complicit in promoting restrictive housing practices.\" Facebook users also sued the company for violating the Fair Housing Act.  Egan said in her post that Facebook has been meeting with some of those Congress members as well as Congress's black and Hispanic caucuses \"to combat wrongful discrimination.\"  In addition to disabling the ethnic affinity tool for certain categories, Egan says Facebook will \"require advertisers to affirm that they will not engage in discriminatory advertising.\"  The advertising issue comes at a time when some Facebook users are already feeling uneasy about the realization that certain content may be excluded from their news feed.  Following the presidential election this week, there were renewed complaints that Facebook is keeping its users in \"filter bubbles\" that effectively eliminate any news that users don't like or agree with.

{"text": "Nearly 20,000 anti-Semitic tweets have been directed at more than 800 journalists since the 2016 presidential campaign began, often because those journalists voiced critical opinions about Donald Trump, the Anti-Defamation League said Wednesday. The anti-Semitic Twitter attacks, which have increased as the campaign has gone on, represent what the ADL describes in a new report as a \"disturbing\" and \"execrable\" trend.  \"There is evidence that a considerable number of the anti-Semitic tweets targeting journalists originate with people identifying themselves as Trump supporters, 'conservatives' or extreme right-wing elements,\" the ADL report states.  While the ADL is careful to note that Trump did not support these tweets, the group says he \"may have contributed to an environment in which reporters were targeted\" because of his anti-media rhetoric, which has included labeling reporters \"absolute scum\" and saying that while he did not want to kill reporters, he did \"hate them.\"  The ADL says it found 2.6 million tweets \"containing language frequently found in anti-Semitic speech\" between August 2015 and July 2016. 19,253 of those tweets were directed at American journalists, the ADL found; the top 10 most targeted journalists (all of whom are Jewish) received 83 percent of them.  Julia Ioffe, a Washington-based journalist, received tweets that referred to her using slurs and said \"Back to the Ovens!\" after she wrote a profile of Melania Trump for GQ.  Jonathan Weisman, an editor at The New York Times, was sent images of ovens and of himself wearing Nazi \"Juden\" stars after tweeting about casino magnate Sheldon Adelson's support for Trump, and after making note of the responses to Ioffe's article.  Hadas Gold, a reporter at Politico, recently received an image of herself wearing a Nazi \"Juden\" star with a bullet hole in her head because she had been critical of Trump.  \"Anti-Semitism has a long history,\" Gold told CNNMoney, \"but this election has brought about a rise in fear of the 'other' and despite being a vital part of American history for hundreds of years, Jews are often still seen as the other.\"  Journalists and news organizations have wrestled with how to respond to such attacks.  In an interview with CNNMoney, Weisman said his initial response was to retweet the attacks in order to call attention to them. \"I went through a terrible 24-hour binge where anything that came I retweeted,\" he said. \"It was like kicking a hornet's nest, because people would tweet at me because they knew I'd retweet it.\"  \"My goal was to show that this was out there, this was happening,\" Weisman said, \"but I was aware at the same time that I was doing their bidding. There's no question that by creating a record of it, I spread awareness of alt-right anti-Semitism.\"  In a similar effort to highlight the vitriol, Ioffe tweeted out the image of Gold, but eventually took it down \"out of respect for Hadas,\" she said in a tweet.  The spike in anti-Semitic tweets has led to criticism of Twitter, a company trying to maintain a free and open social platform even as its policy states that users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease.\"  Asked to comment on the ADL's report, a Twitter spokesperson said the company would be introducing new safety improvements in the weeks ahead.  \"Hateful conduct has no place on Twitter and we address this issue every day with government, our partners in civil society and our peers in the technology sector,\" the spokesperson said. \"People must feel safe in order to speak freely and there is a clear distinction between freedom of expression and conduct that incites violence and hate. We continue to invest heavily in our safety policies and tools, and we will roll out additional improvements to both in the coming weeks.\"  As Weisman sees it, Twitter's decision to grant anonymity makes it impossible for them to enforce their rules. As soon as the company shuts down one account, that user can launch another one. \"It's like whack-a-mole,\" he said.  For that reason, Weisman also speculated that many of these anti-Semitic tweets might be coming from individuals with multiple accounts. But he remains shocked and troubled by the vitriol nevertheless.  \"I am troubled by the uptick of hate in this country writ large,\" he said. \"I would not be so bold as to say that anti-Semitism on Twitter is the worst of it. I would say Muslims being beat up in the street, Hispanics being ostracized at school -- those are far worse.\"  \"This is just a single manifestation of growing hate and bullying in this country,\" he said.  Correction: This article originally said that the ADL had found 2.6 million anti-Semitic tweets directed at journalists. In fact, it found 2.6 million anti-Semitic tweets in all, 19,253 of which were directed at journalists.

{"text": "For immigrant-owned small businesses in the U.S., ties to their home countries can be very lucrative. Firsthand knowledge of the culture as well as connections abroad make immigrant entrepreneurs well-positioned to navigate the complicated export landscape.  That's true for Royce Leather, a family-owned leather business in Secaucus, N.J.  Harold Bauer founded Royce Leather in 1974, just one year after moving to the U.S. from Austria.  Today, 65% of his business comes from exporting to 15 countries. That's up from 45% just five years ago.  Bauer, who comes from two generations of leather artisans, has been able to capitalize on family connections in Western Europe (particularly Germany and Austria) for sales leads and distribution partners.  \"That's where we're from -- where we understand the customers best,\" said Billy Bauer, 22, Harold's son and marketing director of Royce Leather.  Billy added that his father's foreign language skills (he speaks five languages) give him an edge in tapping into markets like France and Russia.  Related: I'm a legal immigrant, but not allowed to have a job.   Experts agree that immigrant entrepreneurs have a leg up.  \"Family ties, familiarity with the culture, market, and investment environment in the home country all could facilitate export\" said Qingfang Wang, an associate professor of Geography and Public Policy at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.  Wang is quick to note that not all immigrant-owned businesses are able to leverage these ties, however they do have a \"much higher propensity for participating in transnational activities.\"  Doug Barry, an author and trade specialist with the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service, agrees.  \"Immigrant-owned companies are more likely to export and to be successful in doing so,\" he said. \"Why? One reason is that they just do it. They are comfortable dealing with other cultures.\"  Related: Want to boost sales? Start exporting  This is true of Priska Diaz, a Peruvian immigrant and founder of New York-based startup BittyLab, which makes innovative baby bottles. She didn't anticipate exporting so early on -- her business is just one year old -- but she didn't shy away from it either.  Diaz, who moved to the U.S. at 17, wanted to first build and establish her business in the U.S. market. But due to \"unsolicited international demand\" for her Bare Air-Free Baby Bottles, she started exporting her products (sold via Amazon) (AMZN, Tech30) to Canada, the U.K. and Australia.  Now, international sales make up 10% of her business, which she plans to grow. Diaz, 39, said her childhood friends (who live around the world) are proving to be a real business asset in finding international distribution partners (she's been contacted by distributors in South Africa, Turkey, and the Middle East).  \"There's a level of trust that makes it easier to work with my friends,\" said Diaz.  Ben Guez echoes that sentiment. The French entrepreneur launched electronic cigarette company Ophis a year ago in Beverly Hills. He said his European roots help him bridge partnerships abroad.  \"Our international clients feel confident to talk with two immigrant entrepreneurs,\" said Guez, who co-founded Ophis with Rudy Halioua, also from France.

{"text": "STEM -- the acronym for science, technology, engineering and math -- has sparked a nationwide debate about education, gender, immigration and the future of the U.S. economy. Here are six things you need to know about STEM:  Kids need to get excited about science early.  STEM jobs are growing at 1.7 times the rate of non-STEM jobs, and the U.S. is simply not producing enough candidates to fill them. Only 16% of high school seniors are interested in pursuing STEM careers, according to the Department of Education.  The Obama administration is investing millions of dollars to produce an additional one million STEM undergrads by 2022. But that would barely fill the projected shortage in STEM jobs.  To get more students interested, some universities are changing their approach.  \"[College professors] have changed how they teach in order to draw in a more diverse group,\" said Londa Schiebinger, a professor at Stanford. \"They show you the cool applications first -- then they bring in the theory and more difficult techniques. It's hooking people in and showing them what they can do with the skills.\"  Related: Few female engineers and execs at Google  But it's got to happen sooner -- starting in kindergarten -- in order to attract a diverse mix and spur innovation.  \"How much cooler would STEM be if we got the creative juices of broader segments of the population?\" said Schiebinger.  STEM grads aren't just important for engineering.  74% of college graduates with STEM degrees are going into non-STEM jobs, according to the Census Bureau. They're pursuing careers in everything from healthcare and law to education and social work.  While that's bad news for employers hoping to fill STEM positions, the graduates are highly sought after and earn higher wages than their non-STEM counterparts, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.  \"You want them to go on to higher value-added pursuits. You want them to start their own companies,\" said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of Georgetown's Center on Education and the Workforce. \"Having a technical degree is the best foundation to give you the most choice in this economy.\"  Related: Young women raise big bucks for startups  Just in case there's any doubt: Microsoft's (MSFT, Tech30) Satya Nadella, Amazon's (AMZN, Tech30) Jeff Bezos and Yahoo's (YHOO, Tech30) Marissa Mayer all have engineering degrees -- and none are technically working in a \"STEM\" field.  Fewer women are graduating with computing degrees.  These numbers have actually decreased over the past two decades. According to the National Center for Women & Information Technology, women made up just 18% of computer science college grads in 2012. In 1985, it was 37%.  \"Women are becoming discouraged from computer science because it's a boy's club,\" said Vivek Wadhwa, fellow at Stanford Law School and author of Innovating Women. \"We need to level the playing field, change our practices. We've created the shortage for ourselves.\"  Computer science is a growing sector, and it's important for women to be a part of that growth. Employment opportunities are projected to grow 15% from 2012 to 2022 (that's faster than average), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   Not all STEM jobs are created equal.  Though women earn roughly half of all bachelor's degrees in STEM fields, according to the National Science Foundation, their concentrations differ from their male counterparts.  Women tend to specialize in less lucrative STEM fields, according to FiveThirtyEight. They pursue careers in health and life sciences, while men are more likely to go into computer science and engineering (which tend to pay more).  Related: Women thrive in China's booming tech scene  The salary difference can be substantial. Nutritional science majors (86.4% of whom are women) earn a median $35,000 out of college. Meanwhile, Mining and Mineral Engineering majors (roughly 90% of whom are men) make a median $75,000 out of college.  Foreigners aren't taking Americans' jobs.  Foreign students gravitate toward STEM fields like medicine and computer software design, which have some of the lowest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Partnership for a New American Economy.  These are also jobs that U.S. companies consistently struggle to fill -- much more than their non-STEM counterparts, according to a Brookings report.  That means foreigners aren't keeping native workers in those fields from finding jobs.  Moreover, immigrants bring knowledge of global markets, which is key for innovation, according to Wadhwa.  The U.S. will be increasingly reliant on foreign talent.  Foreign students study STEM or business fields at a higher rate than American students (about 66% compared to 48%), according to a separate report from Brookings.  Moreover, the number of native-born students pursuing STEM degrees is growing at just 1% a year.  Related: Women take on manufacturing  Members of Congress have introduced efforts to make it easier for foreign STEM graduates to get a green card.  But mobilizing homegrown talent is also a priority for the Obama administration, which is putting $35 million toward a STEM teacher training competition and mentoring initiative that will connect students to tech workers.  Encouraging more people, especially women, to consider STEM fields is key to ensuring the U.S. doesn't suffer a massive brain drain when foreign talent leaves the country.  \"We still need immigrants. [But] we need to encourage women to enter those fields,\" said Wadhwa. \"[Then] immigration can take its natural path.\" ", "date": "October 10, 2014: 2:18 PM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/25/smallbusiness/stem-facts/index.html", "author": "Sara Ashley O'Brien"},

A new report by Oil & Gas UK predicts that 43% of British oil fields in the North Sea will lose money this year if oil prices remain around $30 per barrel.  The trade association expects spending on new oil projects will fall below \u00a31 billion ($1.4 billion) in 2016, compared to \u00a38 billion ($11.3 billion) in a typical year.  \"We are an industry at the edge of a chasm,\" said Deirdre Michie, CEO of Oil & Gas UK, in a statement.  Crude prices are currently trading around $33 per barrel after falling by about 70% since the summer of 2014.  The industry is awash with excess oil. Slowing demand growth, and the decision by OPEC -- led by Saudi Arabia -- to keep producing at near record levels, is keeping markets oversupplied.  Related: Oil investment weakest in 30 years  Saudi Arabia and Russia recently agreed to freeze oil output. But that agreement alone is unlikely to boost prices much in the near term.

Saudi and Russian average production costs are much lower, at $9.90 and $17.20 respectively.

Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), most famous for its Grand Theft Auto series of games, is not far from one either.  There's excitement about upcoming games from all three companies -- particularly with the holidays rapidly approaching.  Activision just hosted an event last weekend for fans of the \"Call of Duty\" action shooter series. The next game in the franchise -- \"Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare\" -- is due out in November.  EA is expected to continue minting money from two popular \"football\" games -- one based on the NFL and another on soccer, aka football to the world outside the U.S. \"Madden NFL 17\" came out last month while FIFA 17 hits shelves on September 27.  Related: Sony brings PlayStation games to smartphones  And even though Take-Two doesn't have a sequel to its popular GTA V game (released in 2013) due out until next year at the earliest, the latest updates in Take-Two's NBA and WWE 2K sports franchises should do well.  All three companies are expanding their mobile presence as well.  Activision made the biggest move in that area with the purchase of \"Candy Crush\" game maker King Digital for nearly $6 billion earlier this year.  EA's mobile sales now account for nearly 15% of total revenue as well. And Take-Two has a stake in privately-held mobile game developer Scopely, which has a game tied to the hit TV show \"The Walking Dead.\"  Mobile gaming will become increasingly important for these companies -- even as Sony (SNE), Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) and Nintendo (NTDOY) continue to churn out new consoles. These three aren't expected to unveil their next generation of hardware until 2017 though.

That may be one of the reasons why shares of gaming retailer GameStop (GME) have lagged lately.  But the fact that the big three software developers are near record levels is a sign that there's more to the industry than augmented and virtual reality.

It has quietly built a censorship tool that would keep certain posts out of people's news feeds, according to The New York Times. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made no secret of his desire to get the giant social network unblocked in the world's most populous nation.  He has traveled to China repeatedly, meeting with the country's propaganda chief during a visit earlier this year and taking heat on social media for \"pandering\" to the government by jogging through polluted Beijing streets without a face mask. He is even studying Mandarin.

The report comes at a sensitive time for Facebook. Zuckerberg insists he does not want to play the role of an editor, yet he recently announced plans to help prevent fake news being shared on Facebook just days after playing down the problem.

For one thing, censorship alone is unlikely to be enough.

Related: China holds 'World Internet Conference' as censorship intensifies  Facebook would have to comply with China's tough legal requirements for handing over user information to authorities. American businesses have criticized a new Chinese cybersecurity law, warning its requirements for data sharing could potentially expose personal information.  Creating a censorship program to appease China could also undermine the trust of non-Chinese users.  \"It has potential to call into question the ethics of the company, call into question whether if you're doing that (in China) ... what are you doing with my content?\" said Mark Natkin, managing director at market research firm Marbridge Consulting in Beijing.  By making such a tool available in China, Facebook could face pressure from other governments around the world to implement it elsewhere.  Related: Why smartphone owners can't tell if their data is being sent to China  Even if Facebook does enough to satisfy the Chinese government, it would face huge competitive hurdles.  Facebook clones like Renren and Kaixin have already long gone out of fashion China. The dominant players now are WeChat and Weibo, both hugely popular social networking sites with hundreds of millions of users.  Facebook, the world's largest social network, would in theory offer Chinese users the possibility of connecting with people all around the globe. WeChat and Weibo haven't been able to replicate their success outside of China.  But Chinese internet users who really want to get on Facebook can already do so through a Virtual Private Network, or VPN, which enables them to skirt China's huge censorship apparatus known as the Great Firewall.  \"I don't think people even care,\" Natkin said. He summed up the likely response from many Chinese people as, \"You came to China, good for you. I'm not going to use you anyway.\" ", "date": "November 23, 2016: 9:34 AM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/23/technology/facebook-china-censorship-tool/index.html", "author": "Sherisse Pham"},
{"text": "The latest plunge in oil prices is putting a smile on the faces of millions of Americans. But should it? Sure, the stunning crash in oil prices below $27 a barrel seems great for consumers because it's driven gas at the pump to nearly $1 a gallon in some places. And the thinking is that it should help boost the U.S. economy, with people spending their gas savings.  But cheap oil is also causing mayhem in global stock markets. The financial headlines at the start of 2016 are downright scary. With that backdrop, any euphoria over low oil prices is questionable. Here's why:  It's rocking your retirement account: The Dow has plummeted 1,800 points so far this year and CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index is flashing \"extreme fear.\" You're not going to be happy when you open your 401(k) statement. The freakout on Wall Street has been largely driven by the crash in oil. It's caused energy profits to plunge and slammed stocks like Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP).  Oil companies are dying: The U.S. energy boom was fueled by expensive drilling technology that was designed for far higher oil prices and paid for with lots of debt. Those loans are now much harder to pay off. Oil and natural gas bankruptcies spiked 379% last year, according to consulting firm Gavin/Solmonese. Many more are expected to succumb to financial trouble in the coming months.  Big banks are bracing for losses: It's never a good sign when the country's financial lifelines are under stress. Large U.S. banks JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) that helped bankroll the energy boom are already setting aside billions to cover potential loan losses in the oil industry. Investors are worried about imploding energy loans for European banks like Deutsche Bank (DB). High yield bonds in your investing portfolio wont be looking good either -- Standard & Poor's warned that half of all energy junk bonds are at risk of defaulting.  Pink slips are flying in the oil patch: Profits at energy giants Chevron and Exxon Mobil fell over 50% around the middle of last year. No wonder many American oil companies, including Halliburton (HAL) and ConocoPhillips (COP) have aggressively slashed expenses to counter lower earnings. Government statistics indicate the energy industry slashed 130,000 jobs in 2015. Actual job losses that include oil-related businesses are likely higher.  Cheap oil could signal trouble in the global economy: When economies are booming, they consume lots of oil -- and vice versa. That's why Wall Street is worried that the drop in energy prices suggests the global economy is slowing down more than already feared. A severe global slowdown would be very bad news for large U.S. companies like Coca-Cola (KO) and McDonald's (MCD) to Caterpillar (CAT) that serve customers abroad.  Emerging markets are getting crushed: The oil crash raises the risk of a full-blown crisis in the emerging market world. Many economies like Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia and Russia are powered by energy exports. Brazil's longest recession since the 1930s is getting worse and the currencies of Russia and Mexico have plunged to all-time lows. The U.S. has deep trade relations with many of these countries, and that will undoubtedly take a blow.  More trouble in the Middle East: The decline in oil prices adds a new element of instability to the Middle East. Tensions rose sharply earlier this year between OPEC kingpins Saudi Arabia and Iran, which can't help the already-volatile region.  Home foreclosures are rising in oil states: It's a big negative for previously-booming oil states like Texas. The Lone Star state experienced a 16% jump in foreclosure activity in 2015, while foreclosures in Oklahoma and North Dakota also rose sharply.  U.S. energy independence dealt a blow: Domestic oil output has skyrocketed in recent years, leaving the U.S. less reliant on countries in the Middle East for energy. However, with some U.S. oil companies closing shop, domestic production has slowed in recent months. That's exactly what Saudi Arabia wanted when it embarked on a strategy of flat-out production that has kept prices lower than U.S. companies can survive on.  Are people even spending their gas savings? The idea that cheap oil is a net positive for the U.S. hinges on the consumers spending the money they're saving at the pump. The average household saved $540 in 2015 from cheap gas. However, it remains a bit of a mystery whether that actually led to spending at a significant level. U.S. retail sales actually fell slightly in December despite the fact that gas prices continued to fall at the end of last year.

{"text": "The iPhone 7 has arrived. Apple announced its next-generation smartphones and a slew of other products at its annual press event on Wednesday.  It kicked off with Apple CEO Tim Cook doing a little Carpool Karaoke with James Corden and Pharrell. The company recently bought a Carpool Karaoke TV series exclusively for Apple Music that will debut next year.  And then the news got underway. From two brand new iPhones to a waterproof Apple Watch, here's a look at everything Apple announced:  iPhone 7 focuses on photography  Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus come in new shades of black and have improved cameras.  It's water and dust resistant, which is different from waterproof but still an improvement over \"easily killed by water.\"  The iPhone is Apple's bread and butter. The company has sold over 1 billion of the devices since it launched in 2007, according to Cook. The latest version isn't a huge departure from the iPhone 6S, but it has a few key upgrades.   The larger iPhone has two side-by-side12-megapixel cameras. One is wide angle and one is telephoto. It gives users 2x optical zoom and 10x digital zoom. In the future, both cameras will be used at the same time to get a shallow depth-of-field effect, but that feature wasn't ready at launch. The smaller iPhone 7 still has one, lonely camera on the back.  The cameras on both phones have been updated with an optical image stabilizer, a new lens and a 12 megapixel sensor. The flash has four LEDs and can detect the flickers of artificial lighting to better compensate.  Related: Apple kicks off iPhone event with Carpool Karaoke  The Home button is now force sensitive. Instead of knowing you pressed the button because it clicked, it will vibrate. Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller said the revolutionary new button is \"creating new feelings and experiences that could not have been created before.\"  The iPhone 7 now comes in two new colors: a high gloss jet black finish and a matte black. It's also still available in gold, silver and rose gold (yes, pink). The phones will ship with iOS 10. Existing iPhones can upgrade to the new mobile OS on September 13.  The new iPhones will be available September 16 and start at $649. And, finally, the 16GB entry level version has been nixed. The new phones will come with 32GB, 128GB and 256GB of storage.  Goodbye, headphone jack  Rest in peace, iPhone headphone jack. As expected, Apple has removed the port from the iPhone 7. Wired headphones, like Apple's own EarPods, will now connect over the Lightning port instead. Apple spun the controversial decision a few ways. First, we don't lose a port, we gain improved stereo speakers! Schiller said the decision took courage -- \"the courage to move on and do something new that betters all of us.\"  To help ease the transition, Apple made an adapter that it will include with all iPhone 7 and 7 Pluses.  Related: Super Mario coming to Apple's App Store!  Apple is also introducing AirPods, wireless headphones that you will probably lose in the first month. The little wireless buds come with a white case for charging, and get up to five hours of listening time per charge. Infrared sensors detect when they're in your ears. The headphones include microphones and one-tap Siri access, powered by built-in accelerometers.  The wireless headphones will cost $159 when they come out in late October.  A new, waterproof Apple Watch  It might look the same on the outside, but Apple introduced a waterproof Apple Watch that is 50% faster and has a brighter display. It also has built in GPS. This is the first hardware update since the watch was launched last year. The new version is clumsily named Apple Watch Series 2.  The device is waterproof up to 50 meters deep. To make it waterproof, Apple changed the speaker design so after a swim, surf, or bubble bath, it can expel any water automatically. The GPS doesn't sever all ties with the iPhone, but does give the Apple Watch a slightly longer leash.  There's a new white ceramic option, which makes it look like a little iPod on your wrist. A trio of new leather Hermes bands might appeal to fashionistas. Apple is also teaming up with Nike (NKE) on a special edition, the Apple Watch Nike+, specifically for motivating and tracking runners.   The Apple Watch Series 2, which will be available in late October, will start at $369. The original watch is still available, but now has the faster processor and starts at $269. Current Apple Watch owners can pretend they have a new watch on September 13, when the new watchOS is released.  Ceramic is now the most expensive Apple Watch, and starts at $1,249. Apple is no longer selling the high-end Apple Watch Edition, an actual gold device that cost between $10,000 and $17,000.   Super Mario on iOS   There's a brand new Super Mario game coming to iOS later this year. Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto came on stage to demo Super Mario Run, which can be played with one hand and comes with a battle mode. You can compete against players around the world. It's not an Apple Car, but it was a huge crowd pleaser.   Pokemon Go comes to the Apple Watch   Pokemon Go is coming to the Apple Watch, a natural fit for the augmented reality game and fitness wearable. The game has been downloaded more that 500 million times since it was launched, according to John Hanke, founder and CEO of Niantic. Its players have walked more than 4.6 billion kilometers. The game will be available on the Apple Watch later this year.  iWork gets collaborative  The suite of work programs is adding real-time online collaboration, a la Google Docs and Microsoft Office. It works across Macs, iPads, iPhones and web versions of iWork apps.

{"text": "Samsung released new guidance for Galaxy Note 7 users on Saturday: Turn off the phone and bring it in for a replacement phone. The message comes a week after Samsung announced it would immediately stop selling the phone and replace the 2.5 million it had already sold.  Samsung (SSNLF) is not calling what it is doing a recall and instead labels it a \"global replacement program.\" But, let's face it, it's a recall. Both Verizon (VZ, Tech30) and AT&T (T, Tech30) are calling it a recall on their websites.  Samsung didn't respond to CNNMoney's request for comment. So we reached out to the U.S. call center and a representative said Note 7 users should power off the phone and bring it back to the retail location where it was purchased. Customers must bring the phones with them to receive a refund or a different model.  Here's what you should know:  What's the problem?  There's a risk that the Note 7 can catch fire while charging due to problems with the battery. The issue is only believed to affect 0.1% of all devices.  Samsung said last week that it had found only 24 phones to be defective.  In the U.S., the Consumer Product Safety Commission urged users to power down their phones and said it would be providing guidance about an official recall \"as soon as possible.\"  The \"exchange program\" comes as rival Apple unveiled its new iPhone 7 on Wednesday. Samsung is the world's biggest selling smartphone maker.  The Note 7 went on sale in August.  What countries are affected?  Sales of the Note 7 were halted last week in 10 countries: the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, the UAE and Korea.  However, notices of the return program were posted on Samsung's global website as well as those of several countries not listed in initial statements about the battery problem.  Phones in China don't appear to be affected because they have a different battery.  What should you do?  Samsung \"strongly\" advised customers to power down their phones and participate in the program in a statement posted on their global website.  Customers are advised to contact their local call centers or visit the retail location where the phone was purchased. In the U.S., customers can call 1-800-SAMSUNG or 1-800-726-7864.  Customers have the option to replace their phone with the Galaxy S7, the Galaxy S7 Edge or a different device and receive reimbursement for the difference.  For Note 7 holders who would prefer to wait for a new model, they will receive a Samsung J Series loaner phone until the new model is released. New Note 7 phones will need CPSC approval before they can be released in the U.S.  Note 7 accessories can also be returned for a refund and Samsung is issuing a $25 gift card, in-store credit or bill credit to users for the inconvenience.  Can I take it on a plane?  Note 7 users can take their phones on board airplanes but the phones must be powered off and cannot be connected to a charging device.  The phones should be carried onto the plane and not stowed in checked luggage, according to guidance from airlines around the world.

{"text": "The internet and social media are great resources for finding information, but they're also the perfect vehicles for spreading misinformation. Fake news stories have been particularly prevalent during this election cycle.  On Tuesday, Fox News host Sean Hannity shared a story about President Obama and the First Lady deleting tweets that endorsed Hillary Clinton. The only problem was that story wasn't true. Hannity later apologized on his radio show, but it was a perfect example of how big names in news can spread fake stories.  Here are five pieces of fake news that were read by millions:  1. Thousands of fraudulent ballots for Clinton uncovered  In October, a story claimed that \"tens of thousands\" of fraudulent ballots had been found in a warehouse in Ohio. The ballots had supposedly been cast for Hillary Clinton and were found inside sealed ballot boxes that would be counted alongside real election ballot boxes.  The story, first published online by the Christian Times Newspaper, was disproven by Snopes -- but not before it went viral.  One website's version of the story was shared with over 6.1 million people, according to Crowdtangle, which tracks the reach and performance of social media posts.  2. Megyn Kelly was fired after she endorsed Clinton  A story claiming that Megyn Kelly was fired by Fox News began circulating in August. It said Kelly was allegedly let go after she endorsed Clinton, criticized Donald Trump and suffered a drop in ratings that placed her behind MSNBC's \"The Rachel Maddow Show.\"  The story was traced to endingthefed.com and was proven to be false -- in fact, Fox News recently offered Kelly over $20 million a year to remain with the network.  Still, one version of the fake story was shared with more than 724,000 people. It was also shared by a \"Colorado for Trump\" Facebook page.  3. The NBA cancels 2017 All-Star Game in North Carolina  The NBA did eventually move the 2017 All-Star Game out of North Carolina -- but not until July.  In April, a story surfaced that said the game was canceled in protest of North Carolina's anti-gay bathroom bill. It was published on a fake site posing as ABC News.  The fake story was picked up and reported by real news sites like Cleveland.com and NBC Sports' ProBasketballTalk. Eventually both sites issued corrections.  The original fake story was shared to more than 2.4 million people on social media. A Keith Olbermann fan page on Facebook was the top source of shares.  4. Elizabeth Warren endorsed Bernie Sanders  In March, a completely fabricated New York Times site published an article claiming that Elizabeth Warren was endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. The story copied the fonts and design of the New York Times, and even used the bylines of two of its political reporters.  The Times was forced to address the fake article and clarify that the site on which it appeared was fraudulent and in no way connected with the real Times.  The original fake article was shared to at least 700,000 people. The top source of the shared link was a Facebook page called \"Bernie Sanders -- The Revolution Continues.\"  5. Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke is a KKK member  In November 2015, a story claimed that Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke had been exposed as a member of the Ku Klux Klan. The story about Clarke, who is African-American, was published by a website called the National Report, but eventually disproven.  Before the story was discredited, it was shared to more than 449,000 people. Comedian DL Hughley even posted the story on Twitter to his hundreds of thousands of followers.

{"text": "Facebook news feeds around the world look a lot different today. Yours might be one of angst and despair, or celebrations and \"I told you so's.\" It depends on the people you're friends with and the online community you've created with your clicks, likes and shares.  Facebook's algorithm knows what you like based on the videos you watch, people you talk to, and content you interact with. It then shows you more of the same. This creates something called \"filter bubbles.\" You begin to see only the content you like and agree with, while Facebook (FB, Tech30) hides dissenting points of view.  This means news on Facebook comes with confirmation bias -- it reinforces what you already think is true -- and people are increasingly frustrated.  Facebook denies it's a media company, yet almost half of U.S. adults get news from Facebook.  When Facebook fired its human curators and began to rely on algorithms to surface popular stories earlier this year, fake news proliferated.  Viral memes and propaganda spread among people with similar beliefs and interests. It's cheaper and easier to create and spread ideological disinformation than deeply-researched and reported news. And it comes from all over -- teens in Macedonia are responsible for a large portion of fake pro-Trump news, according to a BuzzFeed analysis.  Related: The plague of fake news is getting worse -- here's how to protect yourself  Filter bubbles became especially problematic during the presidential election.  Hyperpartisan news sites and fake websites distributed false stories about voter fraud, election conspiracies, and the candidates' pasts that spread like wildfire on Facebook. It was more prevalent on right-leaning Facebook pages. As CNNMoney's Brian Stelter said in response to the growing number of false viral stories, people should have a \"triple check before you share\" rule.  Today, many people are shocked by Trump's victory. Words of fear and sorrow fill their Facebook feeds, and even those with thousands of friends are probably only seeing posts that echo their feelings.  But if you voted for Trump, chances are your feed reflects the opposite. You might see a cascade of #MakeAmericaGreatAgain hashtags and friends celebrating.  Facebook will likely face questions about its responsibility to weed out fake sites and false stories. The company did not respond to questions about whether it plans to modify the news feed algorithms. On an earnings call in July, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued that social media sites actually provide more diversity of opinion than traditional news outlets.   But Facebook is just the vehicle with which friends and family are sharing news. It's not necessarily about trusting the news people see on Facebook, but believing and trusting the people who are sharing it.  The U.S. presidential election starkly illustrated the problems with filter bubbles and personalized social networks. Almost two billion people use the social media site where friends and family share and nurture similar beliefs and false news snowballs. And it raises questions as to the civic responsibility of the world's biggest platform -- and whether or not automated fact-checking could have changed an election.

{"text": "It's time for a new rule on the web: Double, no, triple check before you share. Especially if it seems too good to be true. Why? Look no further than Donald Trump's Twitter account. Trump claimed Sunday morning that \"Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton.\"  Not only was there no proof of this, but it was pretty easy to disprove. The FBI email inquiry was at the top of Google News; FBI director James Comey's name was at the top of Facebook's \"trending\" box; and Twitter's \"moments\" section had a prominent story about the controversy.  Nevertheless, Trump's wrong-headed \"burying\" claim was his most popular tweet of the day. About 25,000 accounts retweeted it and almost 50,000 \"liked\" it, helping the falsehood spread far and wide.  The rise of social media has had many upsides, but one downside has been the spread of misinformation. Fake news has become a plague on the Web, especially on social networks like Facebook. As I said on Sunday's \"Reliable Sources\" on CNN, unreliable sources about this election have become too numerous to count.  So that's why I recommended a \"triple check before you share\" rule.  New web sites designed to trick and mislead people seem to pop up every single day. For their creators, the incentives are clear: more social shares mean more page views mean more ad dollars.  But the B.S. stories hurt the people who read and share them over and over again. Many of these fakes reinforce the views of conservative or liberal voters and insulate them from the truth. The stories prey on people who want to believe the worst about the opposition.  A recent BuzzFeed study of \"hyperpartisan Facebook pages\" found that these pages \"are consistently feeding their millions of followers false or misleading information.\"  The less truthful the content, the more frequently it was shared -- which does not bode well for the nation's news literacy during a long, bitter election season.  \"Right-wing pages were more prone to sharing false or misleading information than left-wing pages,\" the BuzzFeed reporting team said.   On a few occasions, made-up or highly misleading stories have even snuck into Facebook's \"trending\" box -- a problem that the company says it is trying to address.  In a few cases, Trump aides and family members have themselves been duped by fake news stories, including a hoax version of ABC News with a story headlined \"Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: 'I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump's Rally.'\"  A close look at the web site reveals that it is not, in fact, the actual ABC News. But the site tricked Trump's son Eric Trump in early October. \"Finally, the truth comes out,\" he tweeted, promoting a link to the bogus story.  As soon as I spoke about this on television on Sunday, CNN detractors filled my inbox with messages saying that CNN is the ultimate example of \"fake news.\"  But that's a deliberate attempt to confuse the issue. Whatever faults CNN has, news organizations small and large try very hard to report the truth.  Fake news sites and Facebook feeds, on the other hand, traffic in misinformation. My sense is that there are three buckets of these sites:  #1, Hoax sites with totally made-up news headlines that try to trick you;  #2, Hyperpartisan sites that aren't lying, per se, but are misleading, because they only share good news about your political party and bad news about the other party;  #3, \"Hybrids\" that purposely mix a little bit of fact and then a lot of fiction.  These sites aren't going away, so it's up to Internet users to spot fake news and avoid spreading it.  Fact-checking sites like Snopes can help -- they are devoted to ferreting out hoaxes and tricks.  The Sunlight Foundation's Alex Howard tweeted these tips:   Josh Stearns, a longtime media activist who now works at Democracy Fund, said newsrooms also have a role to play.  \"Fact checking has taken center stage in this election, but newsrooms need to go beyond fact checking politicians statements and help debunk viral misinformation too,\" he told me. \"At a time when trust in media is at an all time low, journalists should call out these fake news stories and help citizens tell fact from fiction.\"  Trump's false claim about Google, Facebook and Twitter \"burying\" bad news about Clinton criticized what he called the \"very dishonest media.\" Ironically, he was using Twitter to blast Twitter.  Trump may have gotten the idea from an inaccurate Zero Hedge blog post alleging a \"social media blackout.\" The blog post contained false information.  I asked the Trump campaign to provide a source for the wild claim, but no one has responded.

{"text": "Women -- if you're waiting for the wage gap to close soon, don't hold your breath. Currently, there's no country in the entire world where a woman earns as much as a man for doing the same job. And it's going to take another 81 years for the gender gap to close, according to a new report by the World Economic Forum.  Sure, the gap is narrowing. Very slowly.  The U.S., for instance, narrowed its wage gap by one percentage point to 66% in one year \"meaning that women earn about two-thirds of what men earn for similar work according to the perception of business leaders,\" WEF's economist Saadia Zahidi said. The U.S. also ranked 65th in wage equality among 142 countries in the report.  The WEF measured the pay gap by polling CEOs around the world about salaries of their employees. Here are some other findings.  Italian women don't make even half: Italy and Israel made it to the top of the heap in terms of countries that offer the most equal opportunities for women. But a woman earned only 48% of a man's salary in Italy and 47% in Israel.  Burundi is surprise winner: Some of the world's poorest countries lead the equality ranking. Burundi, where four out of five people live below the poverty line, is the top country in women's pay. Women in the tiny African country earn 83% of salaries of the men in the same jobs.  Women earn more in Denmark: Denmark is the only place where women earn on average more than men -- although the difference is just 2%. But that's because there are many more women in better paid jobs. However, even in Denmark, when they are both doing the same job, a woman will earn 71% of what a man makes.  More powerful in Jamaica and Rwanda: Jamaica, Colombia, Lesotho and Fiji are the only four countries with more female legislators, senior officials and managers. In Jamaica, women do 59% of all top level jobs. Rwanda is the only country with more female parliamentarians -- women hold 64 seats in its 100-seat parliament.  Where women work more: Only four countries in the world have higher proportion of women at work than men. In Malawi 85% of women work compared to 81% of men. Mozambique, Rwanda and Burundi show similar trend.  Fewest women in workforce: At the opposite end, Algeria, Iran and Syria have the lowest female participation in the labor force with less than one in five women working outside their home.  Jordanian women lose the most: Economic prospects for women deteriorated the most in Jordan. Ranked 140, the country finished third from the bottom, ahead of only Pakistan and Syria. Yet just last year, Jordan was ranked 128 in workplace opportunities.  School for all: Girls and women have equal access to education in only 25 of the 142 countries.

{"text": "A Jeep in Florida went up in flames after the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone was left charging in the car. Airlines have warned passengers not to bring the device on planes, and the U.S. issued a dire warning to Samsung customers to power down the phones \"as soon as possible.\" Samsung (SSNLF) has endured a string of brutal headlines since it first issued a massive global recall of the Galaxy Note 7, citing \"battery cell issues\" that can cause the device to catch fire -- and possibly explode.  While the recall may damage Samsung's reputation and has already hurt its stock, the company isn't the first to be upended by its batteries -- and it probably won't be the last.  Just this year, HP (HPQ) and Sony (SNE) have recalled computer batteries for fire hazards, and about 500,000 hoverboards were recalled due to a risk of \"catching fire and/or exploding,\" according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.  What these products all have in common: lithium-ion batteries.  Since their introduction in the early 1990s, lithium-ion batteries have become the gold standard for consumer electronics devices, including smartphones, smartwatches, laptops and cameras.  This is the technology that lets companies squeeze hours of battery life into increasingly slim devices, but it comes with a greater risk of catching fire or exploding in the event of a manufacturing defect.  \"This is a well-known problem. When this goes bad, it goes catastrophically bad in a very high-profile way,\" said Jay Whitacre, a professor at Carnegie Mellon's Department of Materials Science and Engineering.  Case in point: all 50 of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner aircrafts were grounded in 2013 due to concerns about, you guessed it, lithium-ion batteries catching fire.  Related: Confused about the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall? Here's what to do  The problem, according to Whitacre, is that lithium-ion batteries on the market right now rely on \"solvent-based electrolytes\" to pack in more energy, but these electrolytes are flammable. And when something goes wrong, all that energy passing through the battery can boil the electrolytes and cause a fire.  The risk is extremely rare, with some estimating the normal failure rate to be one in ten million batteries. But when there is an error in the battery manufacturing process like Samsung says it experienced, the odds of failure can increase significantly.  Samsung said it has received reports of at least 35 batteries catching fire or exploding out of the 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 devices shipped.  It's a tradeoff, plain and simple.  \"The convenience of them is so great that as a society we take on this risk,\" Whitacre says. \"It's not necessarily comforting, but it's fact.\"  Everywhere you look, you'll find these batteries.  Samsung's chief smartphone rival, Apple (AAPL, Tech30), uses lithium-ion batteries in its iPhones, iPads and MacBooks, according to its website. It's how Apple can squeeze enough battery into a tiny device like the Apple Watch.  \"Compared with traditional battery technology, lithium-ion batteries charge faster, last longer, and have a higher power density for more battery life in a lighter package,\" Apple says on its website.  Tesla (TSLA) also uses lithium-ion batteries in its electric cars, but relies on a cooling system to keep them from overheating.  Businesses and researchers continue to look into new battery technologies, but these lithium-ion batteries remain the standard.  \"There is not, at this time, an alternative to lithium-ion,\" says Steve Levine, author of The Powerhouse: Inside the Invention of a Battery to Save the World.  \"It's very hard to meet all of the required metrics,\" Levine says, \"meaning that they last a long time, they undergo punishment, they can be charged and recharged many, many times, and they are relatively safe.\" ", "date": "September 13, 2016: 9:05 AM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/13/technology/samsung-lithium-batteries/", "author": "Seth Fiegerman"},

Jeremy Stoppelman made those comments via Twitter in responding to a former employee's open letter complaining about the company's low wages and the struggle to get by in San Francisco.  The letter, written by Talia Jane, detailed her experiences working at Yelp (YELP) and difficulties affording transportation to and from work, groceries, rent and other necessities.  According to Jane, she made $733.24 bi-weekly and $8.15 an hour after taxes. Her rent costs $1245 a month and daily train fare costs $11.30, which left her very little money to buy food.  Jane posted the letter to Medium on Friday and noted in a later update that she had been let go from the company.  \"This was entirely unplanned (but I guess not completely unexpected?) but any help until I find new employment would be extremely appreciated,\" Jane wrote.

{"text": "If you've found yourself blaming social media for electing Donald Trump, you're wrong. So says Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who was emphatic that his company was not responsible for influencing people's votes.  Fake news stories went viral about both candidates -- although there were far more lies about Hillary Clinton -- and the platform seemed to do to little to filter out inaccurate content. Now, people are wondering how much impact that content had on the outcome of the presidential election.  \"Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook -- of which it's a small amount of content -- influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,\" Zuckerberg said at the Techonomy conference Thursday.  But he didn't just try to absolve Facebook (FB, Tech30) -- he encouraged anyone criticizing the company to do some soul searching of their own.  \"I do think there is a profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone could've voted the way they did is fake news.\"  Related: Facebook shows you what you want to see post-election  His comments demonstrated a bit of a misunderstanding about how people use social media. A recent Pew study found that 20% of users have \"modified their stance on a social or political issue because of material they saw on social media.\"  This election cycle, some of the top fake news stories were shared millions of times on Facebook.  Already, Facebook's news feed creates filter bubbles -- its technology learns the kind of content you like and shows you more of it, pushing opposing opinions lower in your feed or not showing them to you at all.  Zuckerberg said Facebook's internal research suggests filter bubbles are not a problem, and that Facebook provides greater diversity of information than other media outlets. (Other research has suggested the opposite.)  Nearly two billion people use Facebook, and it's in the unique position of controlling what information, news, events, and interests those people see.  Zuckerberg gave no indication that Facebook was doing a post mortem on its role in the election except to say that the platform is always changing and \"it's not fully formed, and we'll keep improving it.\"  Related: The plague of fake news is getting worse  Other tech firms may also be going through a self-reckoning.  Twitch cofounder and tech investor Justin Kan told CNNMoney's Laurie Segall that companies should take a look at the role technology played in this election.  \"Have we created systems that bring us together to find common ground, or have we created systems that divide us?\" Kan said.  Twitter alums also reflected on the role Twitter played in the election. Software engineer Ben Matasar posed the question to his former colleagues: What did we build?  Responses to his tweet from former Twitter employees varied. Some called Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) a platform for positive connections, others a \"destroyer of worlds.\"  A significant social autopsy is required to understand the role technology, Facebook and the dissemination of fake news played in this election. But unless tech companies truly reckon with the power they have to wield information and influence beliefs, the bubbles we create for ourselves aren't likely to go away.

The feature is almost exactly like Meerkat and Twitter's (TWTR, Tech30) Periscope tool. The biggest difference is that the option is built into the main Facebook (FB, Tech30) app instead of a standalone app, which should help it appeal to more users. And like all things Facebook, the default is to just share privately with your friends, though the settings can be changed.  Earlier this year, Facebook tested the Live feature with celebrities. People like The Rock and Martha Stewart had access to the tool, but no mere mortals. Until now.  The new feature is still in the early testing phase, meaning only a few lucky U.S. iPhone users will actually be able to try it out. Facebook did not say when it would roll out to a wider audience.  Like Periscope, people can post comments during the broadcast and you can see how many fans are tuned in.  Friends who missed a live broadcast can rewatch it on your Timeline. Those who find you especially compelling can even subscribe and get an alert next time you go live.  Videos are huge for Facebook, which said earlier this year that users watch over 3 billion videos every day.  Facebook is also adding a new collage feature that combines photos and videos from a location or day into one post. Collages will be available to iPhone users first and appear on Android next year.

Chinese leaders have typically used the conference to push their doctrine of \"internet sovereignty,\" under which countries would impose their own online borders and regulations.  China's goal \"poses a real threat to the global and open nature of the internet,\" said Patrick Poon, a researcher at Amnesty International.  Amnesty has documented a marked uptick in censorship and restriction of freedom of expression in China over the past year, Poon told CNNMoney, including the detention of at least 20 people in connection with a letter posted online criticizing Chinese President Xi Jinping.  Livestreaming, online TV shows and state media have all come under pressure, and there has been an increase in censorship of social media, Poon said.  Related: China cracks down on growing live streaming industry  In the past year or so, Chinese censors have also cracked down on tools that allow people to subvert or bypass the so-called Great Firewall, the country's colossal internet filtering and censorship apparatus.  Xi was the keynote speaker at last year's conference, declaring that \"no country should interfere in other countries internal affairs or support activities ... that undermine other countries' national security.\"  His government has carried out a number of moves in the past year to further that goal, including the introduction of a new cybersecurity law tightening censors' already iron grip on the country's internet.

It drew criticism from international business and human rights groups.  Amnesty International has called on the tech industry to speak out and \"send a clear message to the Chinese government that they were not prepared to be complicit in the widespread abuse of the rights to freedom of expression and privacy.\"  But China's huge market appears to be too big a prize for many leading Western tech companies.

The massive recall of one of Samsung's flagship devices is an embarrassing setback for the world's biggest selling smartphone maker. The Note 7 was unveiled just a month ago, and big rival Apple (AAPL, Tech30) is expected to show off its new smartphone next week.

The company originally said it would take about two weeks to prepare the recall, but later announced Note 7 users in the U.S. can exchange their device for a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge, starting next week. It will also refund the cost of Note 7-specific accessories.  Samsung is giving Note 7 users a $25 gift card or bill credit for the inconvenience.  More details about how the recall program will work will be announced shortly, the company said. In the meantime, people worried about their batteries should contact their nearest Samsung service center.  Target and Amazon said Friday that it has stopped selling the phone and is working with Samsung to replace the devices already sold in stores and online.

{"text": "Samsung wants to keep it simple. The company is cleaning up its line of flagship smartphones so users now have three choices: a Galaxy, a Galaxy Edge or a Galaxy Note. That's why the new Note 7, which was announced on stage at event on Tuesday, looks a lot like Samsung's previous plus-sized smartphones, the Note 5 and S6 Edge+. Coming in with a 5.7-inch Quad HD resolution display, the Note 7 is Samsung's answer to best the 5.5-inch iPhone 6S Plus.  Samsung says it skipped over the Note 6 in favor of the Note 7 name to \"unify [its] product portfolio\" and \"minimize confusion.\"  With a curved, waterproof metal and glass body, the Note 7 borrows some designs and features from the popular 5.5-inch Samsung Galaxy 7 Edge, including the always-on display and \"edge\" panel of apps.  Related: Samsung shows off Galaxy S7, S7 Edge  But under the hood, the Note 7 includes several unique features such as an iris scanner, which allows users to unlock the phone with their eyes. It also comes with a waterproof stylus, a built-in program to make GIFs and a series of features which make the device super secure. It comes in four flavors, too: black, gold, silver and blue coral.  CNNMoney got an early look at the Note 7 ahead of the announcement. Can another plus-sized smartphone stand out in an extremely saturated market? Let's take a closer look at what you can expect:  Iris scanner  The iris scanner is probably the most buzzed-about feature to land on the Note 7, but Samsung isn't the first to use it as a biometric security. Fujitsu, Alcatel and Chinese manufacturer ZTE already make phones with similar technology.  So how does it work? Samsung has added a new infrared camera that scans your eyes using infrared light emitted from the LED on the front of the phone.   You'll want to hold it about a foot away from your face, and the phone will show how to line it up your eyes. (Don't worry, you won't be surprised with a flash of light.) The data collected from the scan is saved and encrypted on the phone, and you can opt to unlock your phone or a specific app that way moving forward.  Samsung says glasses and contact lenses (particularly colored ones) can get in the way at times, but we weren't wearing either when the scanner experienced issues during our brief testing.  Although, in theory, the scanner is a novel way to keep phones locked, you'll still need to use your fingers to get to the iris scanner from the lock screen -- at which point, you could easily type in a passcode or use the fingerprint reader instead.  \"Secure Folder\"  Like BlackBerry (BBRY, Tech30) and other device manufacturers this year, Samsung is placing an emphasis on security. In addition to the iris scanner, the company also created a separate folder on the Note 7 for sensitive files.  The new \"Secure Folder\" is protected by Samsung's hardware-level KNOX security, and can be unlocked with an additional layer of protection by using a passcode, fingerprint or iris scan.  \"Symmetrical\" design  Compared to its predecessor (the Note 5), the Note 7 is an unquestionable upgrade in design. The front edges of the phone are curved like the Galaxy S7 Edge, but so are the back edges.  While this may seem like a minor adjustment, it does make the Note 7 slightly more comfortable to hold. But that difference is hard to notice because the Note 7 is also slightly bigger and heavier than the S7 Edge.  Compared to the Galaxy S6 Edge+ and Galaxy S7 Edge   The Note 7's 5.7-inch screen sits inside a body that's slightly smaller but thicker and heavier than the Galaxy S6 Edge+.  It's noticeably larger and heavier than the Galaxy S7 Edge, which has a 5.5-inch screen, but not by much.  The Note 7 comes with a standard base of 64 GB of expandable storage -- unlike the Galaxy S6 Edge+, which only came with 32 GB or 64 GB of fixed storage. The Galaxy S7 Edge currently only comes with 32 GB of expandable storage. Meanwhile, the latest smartphone features a 3500 mAh battery, compared to 3600 on the S7 Edge and 3000 mAh on the S6 Edge+ and Note 5.   GIF-maker  Samsung has a knack for taking popular digital habits and baking them into its phones. Last year, it made it easier for people to launch live-streams from their Note 5 via a feature directly through the camera and this year, the focus is on GIFs.  With a Note 7, users will be able to take clips from YouTube or their own videos to create shareable GIFs without downloading any extra software. This will require users to use the \"Smart Select\" feature through the S Pen stylus.  Waterproof writing  Just like the Galaxy S7 Edge, the Note 7 is waterproof for about a half an hour in up to 5 feet of water. And yes, because the Note 7 features Samsung's S Pen, the stylus is just as waterproof.  The combination means that if you ever need to, you could write notes underwater and pin it to your lock screen.   Pricing and availability   Pre-orders for the Note 7 begin Wednesday. Carriers expected to start selling on August 19.  T-Mobile  (TMUS)and Sprint (S) customers can buy the device for $850, while AT&T (T, Tech30) has it priced at $880, spread over its payment plans.  Verizon (VZ, Tech30)'s retail price falls in the middle at $864.

{"text": "The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Samsung are urging owners of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones to stop using the devices while they work to formalize how a recall will work. The warning comes a week after Samsung (SSNLF) announced a voluntary recall of 2.5 million phones worldwide because of a battery problem believed to affect 0.1% of all devices. Some customers reported that their Note 7s caught fire.  A government recall would outlaw the selling of the phone. In its statement, the agency asked owners of the Note 7 \"to power them down and stop charging or using the device\" in the meantime.

It urged them to visit their nearest Samsung service center where they will receive a different phone.  It wasn't immediately clear whether the advice is being extended to the other eight countries where Samsung is recalling the Note 7.

{"text": "Radio host Sean Hannity on Tuesday embraced a piece of fake news about President Obama deleting endorsements of Hillary Clinton from his Twitter account. Hannity used the made-up news to claim that President Obama's legacy might be \"jail.\"  The deleted-tweets claim could have been disproven by a quick Twitter search.  Later in the day, Hannity tweeted a correction and apologized.  The progression of events illustrates how fake news stories expand and spread from fringe web sites to nationally syndicated radio shows with millions of listeners. In this case, the fake news originated on a dubious site called \"Your News Wire,\" which publishes a mix of true, slanted and made-up news. Then, like a game of telephone, by the time the story got to Hannity, even the fake facts were wrong.  The site wrongly claimed that \"Michelle Obama has scrubbed all references to Hillary Clinton from both of her Twitter accounts\" and implied that it was the result of FBI investigations into Clinton.  A thicket of far-right-wing web sites picked up the story and ran with it. Red State Watcher said the news was \"breaking!\" and News Ninja 2012 said it was \"suspicious.\" \"The rats are jumping ship,\" The Gateway Pundit wrote.  Related: The plague of fake news is getting worse -- here's how to protect yourself  Pro-Trump social media users tweeted about it, further amplifying the falsehood. And a contributor to a relatively credible web site, ForexLive.com, posted an item asking \"Is the First Lady distancing the Obamas from the Clintons?\"  Then new characters were added to the fake storyline. \"Elizabeth Warren just unfollowed Hillary, and Michelle Obama deleted all her tweets about Hillary,\" Jack Posobiec, who calls himself a \"recovering political operative,\" tweeted at 2 p.m. Tuesday. He kept going, adding President Obama's name to the list, without any evidence to back it up.  President Obama's @POTUS timeline includes recent tweets like \"Couldn't be more proud of @HillaryClinton.\"  By 4 p.m., the made-up claims were on \"The Sean Hannity Show.\"  First Hannity brought up the Gateway Pundit blog post -- which was predicated on a hoax -- and asked if it was true: \"It says that Michelle Obama had deleted Hillary tweets from her timeline. Did you ever check that out?\" The question is apparently directed at his producer.  Later in the hour, Hannity brought it up again. He was talking about revelations from the Wikileaks trove of stolen Clinton campaign emails when he began to read information about Warren and Obama, then said \"What?\"  A female voice chimed in to report: \"Barack Obama and Elizabeth Warren have both unfollowed Hillary Clinton, as well as scrubbing their timeline of tweets about her.\"  \"Wow,\" Hannity said, and paused. \"That means they know it's huge. You know why? Because Obama's implicated! He's implicated here, and he's pissed. You know what his legacy might be? Jail.\"  Some of Hannity's listeners believed him -- they shared the fake news via Twitter and Facebook. \"wow this is getting good!\" one Hannity fan tweeted.  Hannity did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the error.  But he tweeted after his show, \"Correction. Live on radio I read a gateway pundit report that @MichelleObama had deleted mentions of HRC. And a listener said BHO and. Elizabeth Warren did same. Fact is they didn't. I humbly apologize. Live radio.\"  Then he emailed CNNMoney this explanation: \"I received an e-mail LIVE ON THE AIR that linked a Gateway Pundit article. I questioned the accuracy of it on the air. I asked my producer on the air if it was true. She said it was. I also received a listener IM saying that they saw the same. Then THE listener mentioned that there was a report about the other 2.\"  Hannity continued: \"Bottom line it was brought up in an insignificant way, I was dealing with more important issues like HRC crimes and lies and how CNN has been colluding with the Clinton campaign and CHEATING Bernie Sanders.\" ", "date": "November 1, 2016: 7:02 PM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/01/media/sean-hannity-michelle-obama-hillary-clinton-fake-news/", "author": "Brian Stelter"},
{"text": "It's time for a new rule on the web: Double, no, triple check before you share. Especially if it seems too good to be true. Why? Look no further than Donald Trump's Twitter account. Trump claimed Sunday morning that \"Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton.\"  Not only was there no proof of this, but it was pretty easy to disprove. The FBI email inquiry was at the top of Google News; FBI director James Comey's name was at the top of Facebook's \"trending\" box; and Twitter's \"moments\" section had a prominent story about the controversy.  Nevertheless, Trump's wrong-headed \"burying\" claim was his most popular tweet of the day. About 25,000 accounts retweeted it and almost 50,000 \"liked\" it, helping the falsehood spread far and wide.  The rise of social media has had many upsides, but one downside has been the spread of misinformation. Fake news has become a plague on the Web, especially on social networks like Facebook. As I said on Sunday's \"Reliable Sources\" on CNN, unreliable sources about this election have become too numerous to count.  So that's why I recommended a \"triple check before you share\" rule.  New web sites designed to trick and mislead people seem to pop up every single day. For their creators, the incentives are clear: more social shares mean more page views mean more ad dollars.  But the B.S. stories hurt the people who read and share them over and over again. Many of these fakes reinforce the views of conservative or liberal voters and insulate them from the truth. The stories prey on people who want to believe the worst about the opposition.  A recent BuzzFeed study of \"hyperpartisan Facebook pages\" found that these pages \"are consistently feeding their millions of followers false or misleading information.\"  The less truthful the content, the more frequently it was shared -- which does not bode well for the nation's news literacy during a long, bitter election season.  \"Right-wing pages were more prone to sharing false or misleading information than left-wing pages,\" the BuzzFeed reporting team said.   On a few occasions, made-up or highly misleading stories have even snuck into Facebook's \"trending\" box -- a problem that the company says it is trying to address.  In a few cases, Trump aides and family members have themselves been duped by fake news stories, including a hoax version of ABC News with a story headlined \"Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: 'I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump's Rally.'\"  A close look at the web site reveals that it is not, in fact, the actual ABC News. But the site tricked Trump's son Eric Trump in early October. \"Finally, the truth comes out,\" he tweeted, promoting a link to the bogus story.  As soon as I spoke about this on television on Sunday, CNN detractors filled my inbox with messages saying that CNN is the ultimate example of \"fake news.\"  But that's a deliberate attempt to confuse the issue. Whatever faults CNN has, news organizations small and large try very hard to report the truth.  Fake news sites and Facebook feeds, on the other hand, traffic in misinformation. My sense is that there are three buckets of these sites:  #1, Hoax sites with totally made-up news headlines that try to trick you;  #2, Hyperpartisan sites that aren't lying, per se, but are misleading, because they only share good news about your political party and bad news about the other party;  #3, \"Hybrids\" that purposely mix a little bit of fact and then a lot of fiction.  These sites aren't going away, so it's up to Internet users to spot fake news and avoid spreading it.  Fact-checking sites like Snopes can help -- they are devoted to ferreting out hoaxes and tricks.  The Sunlight Foundation's Alex Howard tweeted these tips:   Josh Stearns, a longtime media activist who now works at Democracy Fund, said newsrooms also have a role to play.  \"Fact checking has taken center stage in this election, but newsrooms need to go beyond fact checking politicians statements and help debunk viral misinformation too,\" he told me. \"At a time when trust in media is at an all time low, journalists should call out these fake news stories and help citizens tell fact from fiction.\"  Trump's false claim about Google, Facebook and Twitter \"burying\" bad news about Clinton criticized what he called the \"very dishonest media.\" Ironically, he was using Twitter to blast Twitter.  Trump may have gotten the idea from an inaccurate Zero Hedge blog post alleging a \"social media blackout.\" The blog post contained false information.  I asked the Trump campaign to provide a source for the wild claim, but no one has responded.

Fox News and its parent company 21st Century Fox have gone all out to keep Kelly, who has fast become their most famous host and one of the most coveted talents in television news.

When ABC announced that Kelly would guest-host for Kelly Ripa on ABC's \"Live with Kelly\" the morning after the election, it set off renewed speculation that she was making a test run at softer morning television.  But Kelly has suggested that she wants a one-on-one interviewer role akin to a Charlie Rose, Barbara Walters or Oprah Winfrey.

{"text": "The iPhone 7 has arrived. Apple announced its next-generation smartphones and a slew of other products at its annual press event on Wednesday.  It kicked off with Apple CEO Tim Cook doing a little Carpool Karaoke with James Corden and Pharrell. The company recently bought a Carpool Karaoke TV series exclusively for Apple Music that will debut next year.  And then the news got underway. From two brand new iPhones to a waterproof Apple Watch, here's a look at everything Apple announced:  iPhone 7 focuses on photography  Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus come in new shades of black and have improved cameras.  It's water and dust resistant, which is different from waterproof but still an improvement over \"easily killed by water.\"  The iPhone is Apple's bread and butter. The company has sold over 1 billion of the devices since it launched in 2007, according to Cook. The latest version isn't a huge departure from the iPhone 6S, but it has a few key upgrades.   The larger iPhone has two side-by-side12-megapixel cameras. One is wide angle and one is telephoto. It gives users 2x optical zoom and 10x digital zoom. In the future, both cameras will be used at the same time to get a shallow depth-of-field effect, but that feature wasn't ready at launch. The smaller iPhone 7 still has one, lonely camera on the back.  The cameras on both phones have been updated with an optical image stabilizer, a new lens and a 12 megapixel sensor. The flash has four LEDs and can detect the flickers of artificial lighting to better compensate.  Related: Apple kicks off iPhone event with Carpool Karaoke  The Home button is now force sensitive. Instead of knowing you pressed the button because it clicked, it will vibrate. Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller said the revolutionary new button is \"creating new feelings and experiences that could not have been created before.\"  The iPhone 7 now comes in two new colors: a high gloss jet black finish and a matte black. It's also still available in gold, silver and rose gold (yes, pink). The phones will ship with iOS 10. Existing iPhones can upgrade to the new mobile OS on September 13.  The new iPhones will be available September 16 and start at $649. And, finally, the 16GB entry level version has been nixed. The new phones will come with 32GB, 128GB and 256GB of storage.  Goodbye, headphone jack  Rest in peace, iPhone headphone jack. As expected, Apple has removed the port from the iPhone 7. Wired headphones, like Apple's own EarPods, will now connect over the Lightning port instead. Apple spun the controversial decision a few ways. First, we don't lose a port, we gain improved stereo speakers! Schiller said the decision took courage -- \"the courage to move on and do something new that betters all of us.\"  To help ease the transition, Apple made an adapter that it will include with all iPhone 7 and 7 Pluses.  Related: Super Mario coming to Apple's App Store!  Apple is also introducing AirPods, wireless headphones that you will probably lose in the first month. The little wireless buds come with a white case for charging, and get up to five hours of listening time per charge. Infrared sensors detect when they're in your ears. The headphones include microphones and one-tap Siri access, powered by built-in accelerometers.  The wireless headphones will cost $159 when they come out in late October.  A new, waterproof Apple Watch  It might look the same on the outside, but Apple introduced a waterproof Apple Watch that is 50% faster and has a brighter display. It also has built in GPS. This is the first hardware update since the watch was launched last year. The new version is clumsily named Apple Watch Series 2.  The device is waterproof up to 50 meters deep. To make it waterproof, Apple changed the speaker design so after a swim, surf, or bubble bath, it can expel any water automatically. The GPS doesn't sever all ties with the iPhone, but does give the Apple Watch a slightly longer leash.  There's a new white ceramic option, which makes it look like a little iPod on your wrist. A trio of new leather Hermes bands might appeal to fashionistas. Apple is also teaming up with Nike (NKE) on a special edition, the Apple Watch Nike+, specifically for motivating and tracking runners.   The Apple Watch Series 2, which will be available in late October, will start at $369. The original watch is still available, but now has the faster processor and starts at $269. Current Apple Watch owners can pretend they have a new watch on September 13, when the new watchOS is released.  Ceramic is now the most expensive Apple Watch, and starts at $1,249. Apple is no longer selling the high-end Apple Watch Edition, an actual gold device that cost between $10,000 and $17,000.   Super Mario on iOS   There's a brand new Super Mario game coming to iOS later this year. Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto came on stage to demo Super Mario Run, which can be played with one hand and comes with a battle mode. You can compete against players around the world. It's not an Apple Car, but it was a huge crowd pleaser.   Pokemon Go comes to the Apple Watch   Pokemon Go is coming to the Apple Watch, a natural fit for the augmented reality game and fitness wearable. The game has been downloaded more that 500 million times since it was launched, according to John Hanke, founder and CEO of Niantic. Its players have walked more than 4.6 billion kilometers. The game will be available on the Apple Watch later this year.  iWork gets collaborative  The suite of work programs is adding real-time online collaboration, a la Google Docs and Microsoft Office.

{"text": "U.S. officials grounded Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner because the aircraft's advanced batteries appear to be malfunctioning. But what's the problem? And can it be fixed? To reduce weight on the plane, Boeing relied heavily on lithium ion batteries -- the same type found in mobile phones and laptops.  While these batteries can produce a lot of power for their weight, they're also prone to problems. It was these same batteries that caught fire in laptops a few years back and, more recently, were suspected culprits in electric car fires.  How they work: Ions from the element lithium tease out energy from the battery's electrodes, according to Donald Sadoway, a materials chemistry professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  This is different from other types of batteries commonly used in electronics, which use a combination of nickel and cadmium or lead and acid, among other things.  Why they're better: Lithium is the lightest of all metals, so its ions hold energy more efficiently -- more than twice as much per unit of weight as nickel cadmium batteries.  This made the batteries attractive for Boeing (BA), which used them to electronically assist some of the functions that were previously performed using hydraulics. A lighter plane is more fuel efficient, which is one of the main selling points for the 787. Other aircraft makers have also been using more lithium ion batteries.  Related: Boeing's Dreamliner fleet grounded  In addition to being light and packing lots of power, lithium ion batteries also require less maintenance. There's no need to fully drain the battery before recharging, as was the case with older nickel cadmium batteries. Plus, they may be less environmentally toxic during disposal.  What's the problem? In addition to being the lightest metal, lithium can also be unstable when combined with other elements. Because of this instability, the batteries are subject to catch fire if they are over charged -- as was the case earlier this month with a 787 at a Boston airport.  To make matters worse, the fires they generate are extremely difficult to put out. The Boston fire took 40 minutes to extinguish, said Cosmin Laslau, a mobile energy analyst at Lux Research, a consulting and research firm focused on emerging technologies.  \"Conventional fire extinguishers do not work,\" said Laslau. \"Unless firefighters have specialized materials, you may just have to let the fire burn itself out.\"  The batteries are also about 40% more expensive than nickel cadmium, and some may not hold a charge very well after a few years.  Can it be fixed? Fixing the fire issue is obviously the main problem. Boeing chose a particularly risky type of chemical makeup in its lithium ion battery, one that provides more power but does not stand up well to overheating, said Laslau.  \"Boeing made a conscious design decision, and is now paying the price,\" he said.  The automakers have been working on the fire problem by using lithium ion batteries with a slightly different chemical makeup, said Laslau, one that is a bit more expensive and provides a bit less power but is more stable. They have have also employed better electrical wiring and systems to manage the battery.  That, he said, is what Boeing will likely need to do.

{"text": "You've probably never heard of him -- or his startup -- but he has the Internet all riled up. In an open letter to San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and police chief Greg Suhr, entrepreneur Justin Keller details why homeless \"riff raff\" are ruining the city.  \"Every day, I see people sprawled across the sidewalk, tent cities, human feces, and the faces of addiction,\" wrote Keller, founder of Commando.io.  But while Silicon Valley has been known to tackle unwieldy problems, Keller isn't suggesting he get his own hands dirty.  He wants Lee and Suhr to step in: \"What are you going to do to address this problem?\" asked Keller, who said he's been living in the city for three years. \"Without a doubt it is the worst it has ever been.\"  Related: This startup is helping homeless people get back on their feet  Keller isn't wrong: The number of homeless people in the city has indeed gone up in recent years, according to the Homeless Point-in-Time Count for 2015.  Moreover, the majority of these homeless people weren't always living on the streets, according to the survey. It found that the vast majority of San Francisco's homeless population (71%) previously had a place to call home in the city.  As San Francisco's rent has skyrocketed -- up 15% in just one year -- residents have been driven out. Some blame the influx of tech workers with huge salaries for gentrification.  Megan Hustings, director at the National Coalition for the Homeless, says that's not completely to blame. She pointed to massive cuts in affordable housing in the 1980s coupled with low minimum wages as big contributors.  \"I don't see San Francisco being any different than any other city. Homelessness around the country has been growing, basically since the 1970s,\" she told CNNMoney.  Related: \"San Francisco is separate from the real world\"  Keller sees it differently.  \"I know people are frustrated about gentrification happening in the city, but the reality is, we live in a free market society ... The wealthy working people have earned their right to live in the city ... I shouldn't have to worry about being accosted.\"  Keller, who published the post on February 15, said he no longer feels safe in his own city. He cites three \"incidents\" over President's Day weekend where homeless men were harassing residents -- including public nudity, yelling and screaming, and physically pushing people.  \"I shouldn't have to see the pain, struggle, and despair of homeless people to and from my way to work every day,\" Keller added.  His letter got a lot of attention for someone who is a relative unknown -- his isn't one of Silicon Valley's highly funded startups. Sites like Crunchbase and Mattermark, which track funding raised by privately-held companies, show no records of financing raised by Commandio.io.  One Twitter user said that the letter made him \"viscerally ashamed to be in tech in SF.\" Sonos product manager Kristen Johansen tweeted, \"This is why I don't live in SF anymore. Not bc of the homeless, but entitled newcomers like @johnny5sf. Disgusting.\"  Others suggested that Keller actually do something to help alleviate homelessness.   In response to all the backlash, Keller tweeted: \"I'm not a rand rich dude. I ride the bus 2 work. I went to a state coll. I live in a studio apt.\"  He later dialed back some of his language, apologizing for the word \"riff raff.\" \"It was insensitive and counterproductive,\" he wrote in an updated post.

{"text": "Samsung's fire-prone smartphones are causing a flameout for its stock. Shares of the world's biggest smartphone maker plunged 7% Monday after the company told owners of its high-end Galaxy Note 7 phone to stop using the devices over concerns they can burst into flames while charging.  Samsung's (SSNLF) alert urging customers to bring their Note 7 phones in for a replacement as soon as possible followed warnings from aviation authorities and airlines that the devices shouldn't be used aboard planes.  The cascade of negative headlines has deepened investors' worries about how badly the Note 7 debacle could hurt Samsung's reputation. The company has already lost a great opportunity to get ahead of its big rival Apple (AAPL, Tech30), which unveiled the iPhone 7 last week.   Related: Confused about the Samsung recall? Here's what to do  \"If a customer is going out to buy a phone, they're going to buy an iPhone 7, not a Note 7,\" said Mark Newman, a Bernstein analyst who covers Samsung. He pointed out that the Note 7 was launched before the iPhone 7 and received better reviews.  Samsung said 10 days ago that it was halting sales of the Note 7 and recalling about 2.5 million of the devices around the globe. The warnings to stop using the phones on planes and elsewhere came at the end of last week.  The cost of the recall is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, analysts say.

{"text": "Next Friday, you'll be able to saunter into your nearest Apple Store and try out the new iPhone models, Apple Watch Series 2, and possibly the new wireless ear buds. (Assuming Apple finds a way to prevent them from being stolen and periodically removes accumulated ear wax.) Until then, we took a test drive for you at a hands-on area after Apple's big event.  AirPods  Imagine, if you will, a pair of classic white Apple headphones. Now take scissors and chop off the wires. You have a pair of headphones that feels the same, but untethered and itching to get lost. At $159, that feels like a big risk to take.  The individual ear buds are incredibly light, weighing in at .14 ounces each. Luckily, they fit snugly, but ears are like snowflakes (they're all unique), and sweaty ears during a workout are like melting snowflakes. The hard plastic buds likely won't fit everyone's ears as well, leading some people to lose them easier than others.   Related: Everything Apple announced at its iPhone 7 event  AirPods keep the same shape at their predecessor, the EarPod, which was released with much fanfare in 2012. At the time, Jony Ive (in a video voiceover, as always) said the shape was carefully designed to fit as wide a range of ears as possible. The final shape was developed by 3D scanning hundreds of ears and determining a common volume, Ive said at the time.  They do come with quite a few nifty features. Each has a built-in microphone for phone calls or using Siri. Sensors mean they know when you're tapping to activate Siri or if they're out of your ear. (The music stops if you take one out, which is rarely my desired effect.) The little recharging case hold the buds in with a magnet and will be a big help for serial headphone losers (guilty!).  Perplexingly, AirPods come with a Lightning to USB cable. You have to charge them from an outlet or device with a USB port, like your laptop. You cannot charge them from your iPhone.  iPhone 7   These are the three most important changes to the iPhone (not including the controversial de-jacking).  1. You can drop either iPhone 7 in up to one meter of water, say, a kiddy pool, and forget to fish it out for up to 30 minutes. The phone isn't fully waterproof, but this increased durability will save hundreds of thousands of iPhones a year from early watery graves.  2. The low-end iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus now come with 32GB of memory instead of 16GB, which has seemed ridiculously small for years.  3. The pair of cameras on the back of the iPhone 7 Plus may not look too different, but they have great potential for iPhone photographers. Right now you can just switch between the cameras to get better optical zoom. In the future, Apple will release an update that uses them together for shallow depth-of-field effects.  Related: Super Mario coming to Apple's App Store!  I tested the zoom on a man across the room. The 2x optical zoom showed his face clearly, and the 10x digital zoom did an impressive job of showing details like the carefully styled wave in his hair.  Apple Watch Series 2   It looks and feels just like the first Apple Watch, except it's just under 1-mm thicker. The new hardware, along with the forthcoming operating system update, does address a lot of the issues with the first version. It has a faster chip that (appears) to eliminate a bit of lag. The screen is two times brighter, according to Apple. A quick glance at an old Apple Watch showed a difference, but nothing mind-blowing.  The most compelling reasons to upgrade from an older watch are GPS and waterproofing. GPS looks great for people who want to take their watch on adventures and leave the phone at home. In addition to recording your runs, there are apps that download useful maps, say for hikes.   The other reason is that you can go swimming. Apple Watch Series 2 is waterproof, not just water resistant. It can go up to 50 meters deep for ocean lovers, or just a few inches if you're more of a hot tub type.  Apple did not provide water at the hands-on, so we look forward to testing the new devices in actual hot tubs.

{"text": "Samsung showed off its newest Galaxy S smartphones on Sunday during Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. With the S7 and S7 Edge, Samsung is doing what it should have done years ago with its flagship Galaxy brand: Sell solid, eye-catching phones with competitive hardware and software features.  The company went half-way with this strategy in 2015 with the S6 and S6 Edge. The models were sleek and beautifully designed, thanks to an all-new aluminum and Gorilla Glass body. But their battery capacities were smaller. The phones were no longer water resistant. And in an effort to push people to use cloud storage, Samsung took away the ability to add memory.  Luckily for fans, these features are back. The S7 and S7 Edge do a better job of balancing good looks and customer friendly features, but they're still not perfect. Here are the highlights.  Design  The S7 and S7 Edge look like refined versions of their predecessors. They're flatter because the rear camera no longer juts out.  The S7 has a 5.1-inch screen, like the S6. But Samsung gave the S7 Edge a bigger display -- 5.5-inches -- without increasing the size of the phone significantly. In fact, the S7 Edge is now a bit smaller than the iPhone 6S Plus, despite the fact that it has the same screen size.  Related: Samsung debuts its first VR camera, the Gear 360  Samsung has also made the curved screen edges twice as wide as before, making it easier for people to read their messages or the news.  Both screens feature a new \"always-on display\" mode so that information such as date, time and notifications are visible without having to unlock the phone.   Features  In the U.S. the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge will come with 32 GB of storage. The expandable memory slot is built into the SIM card tray, and Samsung says up to 2 TB can be supported.  As rumored, both are dust- and water-resistant (up to five feet for half an hour).  Related: 6 cool products to expect from Samsung in 2016  Gamers may like the new Do Not Disturb feature that prevents calls from interrupting playtime, as well as a new battery conservation mode that changes frame rate and other qualities to use less power. Recording and uploading game play videos are now options too.  Battery life  Batteries in the S7 and S7 Edge are 3,000 mAh and 3,600 mAh respectively, and cannot be removed.  The S6 and S6 Edge by comparison had a 2,550 mAh and 2,600 mAh battery, while the S5 had a 2,800 mAh battery.  Camera   If you find yourself taking a lot of low-light photographs and videos, you might appreciate the fact that the cameras on the S7 and S7 Edge can take in even more light than before -- going to an f-stop of 1.7. The widest aperture for the S6 was 1.9.  In a press demonstration, the cameras also seemed to require a noticeably shorter amount of time to focus on objects than the iPhone did.  Price and colors  Pre-orders begin Tuesday. Anyone who pre-orders will receive a free Gear VR. Sales at major wireless retailers in the United States start March 11.  All the major carriers are offering deals for the new phones. Verizon (VZ, Tech30) hasn't set a specific price yet, but will give its customers an extra 24 GB of data every year \"for life.\" AT&T has set the starting price for the S7 at $23 a month for 30 months. And $27 a month for the S7 Edge.  T-Mobile (TMUS) says the S7 will cost $670, or about $28 per month over two years. The S7 edge will cost $780 or about $33 per month. For people who pre-order, the carrier is also offering a free Samsung Gear VR, six VR games, and year of Netflix (NFLX, Tech30).  Not to be outdone, Sprint (S) says it will offer customers the ability to buy or lease one of the new phones and get a second device for half the price.

But it's not clear how the FAA or any U.S. airline can enforce the advisory \u2014 nor how any passenger can be certain that the person in the next seat isn't texting on or charging a phone that has been reported to catch fire.  \"Can they enforce it? Like, you going to go through and make sure you don't have anything bigger than 3 ounces and no Note 7 phones?

On Thursday, the FAA said in a memo that it \"strongly advises\" passengers not to turn on or charge their Note 7s on board an aircraft and not to stow the phones in checked baggage.  The FAA has previously warned that fires caused by the type of batteries found in cellphones can be hard to extinguish aboard planes.  When major U.S. airlines banned unsafe hoverboards last year, some models of which were reported to catch fire and explode, enforcement was simpler. Hoverboard owners weren't allowed to bring their product on a plane.  But a cellphone is much more discreet. Flight attendants have enough trouble policing who has and hasn't switched their phones to airplane mode before takeoff. It's hard to imagine them going row by row, hunting for Note 7s.  \"There are a lot of duties that flight attendants have on board, and there has to be more staffing if this is going to be the case that they have to check every single phone for every single passenger on the plane,\" said Taylor Garland, a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants.  Related: Samsung is recalling the Galaxy Note 7 worldwide over battery problem  Some international airlines, including Singapore Airlines (SINGF), Qantas (QABSY) and Virgin Australia, have already banned use of the Note 7. Those airlines say cabin crews are making announcements on board about the ban.  But protocol in the U.S. isn't entirely clear. United (UAL) and Virgin America (VA) said they would make announcements to passengers, while Delta (DAL) said in a statement that it would comply with any FAA requirements or directives. Southwest (LUV) said it was promoting the guidelines online, but said in-flight announcements were still being discussed.  American Airlines (AAL) said it was \"in touch with the FAA\" regarding the issue, but a spokesman declined to say Friday whether crews would make announcements.  Other airlines, including JetBlue (JBLU) and Spirit (SAVE), didn't respond to requests for comment on the Note 7.  The Transportation Security Administration deferred to the FAA's statement.

{"text": "Samsung has introduced the better, sleeker Galaxy S6 Edge+ and the Note 5 updates to its mega-successful giant phone lineup. Both new phones try to give users as much screen space and processing power as possible in a more solid and slimmer design than their giant-screened predecessors, the Note 4 and the Note 4 Edge (now rebranded S Edge+).  \"We're still betting big on big screens,\" said JK Shin, Samsung's mobile CEO, during the company's \"Unpacked\" event in New York on Thursday.  Pre-orders for the devices began Thursday afternoon, and they will be available in AT&T (T, Tech30), Verizon (VZ, Tech30), T-Mobile (TMUS), Sprint (S) and Best Buy (BBY) stores Friday for people to play around with. The phones will be on sale in stores in the United States on August 21.  Here's what you need to know about each device compared to their predecessors, the Note 4 and the Note 4 Edge.  The Galaxy Note 5   1. Slightly smaller and thinner. At less than 0.3 inches thin, six-inches long and less than three-inches wide, the metal and glass bodied Note 5 is smaller than the Note 4 without sacrificing any of its giant 5.7-inch screen size. Samsung said this phone was designed with multitasking in mind.  2. Better camera. Samsung bumped up the selfie camera to 5 MP in the Note 5 (up from 3.7 MP in the Note 4). Like the Galaxy S6 Edge+, video shot on the Note 5 can be viewed on a 4K TV. For all you Periscope and Meerkat lives-streamers -- there is also a brand new full HD Live Broadcast feature, which lets you stream video privately or publicly to YouTube.  3. An improved pen. The Note's signature \"S Pen\" stylus got some upgrades. You can now write things down even when the screen is off. There's a scroll capture feature, which will let you screen-shot an entire website from top to bottom, and a way to save an image of just part of a page.  4. Battery life could be a bit worse. The Note 4 had a 3220 milliampere battery, while the new Note 5 has a smaller 3000 mAh battery. It's unclear yet what that will mean for battery life -- sometimes software upgrades can improve battery-life more than smaller batteries shorten it.  But Samsung also said its wireless charging has improved so that a full charge takes two hours now instead of three. If you use a cord, expect to wait an hour and a half.  5. Four color options and two memory size options: black (which sometimes looks like a dark blue), white, gold, and silver. In the United States, only the black and gold will be available. It comes with either 32 GB or 64 GB of memory storage. Samsung has removed ability to add expandable memory.  6. Prepare to pay at least $250. That's how much a 32 GB version with a two-year AT&T or Sprint contract will cost. A hundred dollars more will get you a 64 GB version. Without a commitment, expect to hand over $740 or $840 at AT&T, and about $20 less at Sprint.  Galaxy S6 Edge+  1. Screen is curved on both sides, and it's very light. Unlike the Note 4 Edge, which was only curved on the right side, the Galaxy S6 Edge+ curves on both edges. Similar to the smaller Galaxy S6 Edge, the Edge+ 5.7-inch screen allows users to program shortcuts that can be accessed while the phone is face down.  2. Same camera, better filming and broadcasting. The Edge+ features a 16 MP rear camera and 5 MP front camera. Video shot on this phone should look good on a 4K TV, and there is a new live-stream feature which lets you broadcast to contacts or on YouTube live in HD.  3. Only two memory storage sizes. The new phone has a 4 GB RAM and comes in either a 32 GB or 64 GB size. (The Edge also has a 128 GB option.) Samsung has removed ability to add expandable memory.  4. Battery should last longer, but it's still not great. With 3000mAh, it's exactly the same as last year's Note 4 but a bit better than the Edge, which has a 2600mAh battery.  5. There are four two color options: black, white, silver, and gold. In the U.S., only the black and white will be available.  6. It gets expensive. A no-contract 64 GB sized Edge+ will run you $915 at AT&T, or $888 at Sprint. With a two-year agreement, it's $400 at AT&T or $450 at Sprint.  The smaller sized 32 GB will cost $300 with a AT&T contract, and $814 without. Sprint's 2-year agreement deal is $350, and $792 without a contract.

{"text": "Just two weeks after Samsung launched its new Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, the company issued a major recall following dozens of complaints the device caught on fire while charging. While details surrounding the recall are still trickling out, we rounded up everything you need to know about the incident and how Samsung is responding.  What's the Note 7?   The Note 7, which runs on Android, is brand new to Samsung's smartphone lineup. It was announced on stage at a glitzy press conference in New York City on August 2. Devices started to ship on August 19.  At 5.7 inches, the Note 7 is Samsung's competitor to the larger-sized iPhone 6S Plus (5.5 inches). It's buzziest feature is an iris scanner that unlocks the device.  U.S. mobile networks sell the Galaxy Note 7 for at least $850.  It received strong reviews from critics out of the gate -- heralded as sleek and powerful -- but some early users noticed the screen is much more susceptible to scratches than competing smartphones.  So what happened?  Samsung issued a worldwide recall for the Note 7 due to a large-scale battery problem after 35 users complained their device caught on fire while charging.  Post-explosion photos, highlighting burnt and crisp devices, have since popped up on social media sites. One user told CNNMoney he was awoken at night when he \"smelled something burning.\" The phone had melted.   Samsung said most Note 7 phones should not be affected by the issue -- it's believed 0.1% of all devices sold are at risk. The company added that 2.5 million Note 7 devices have sold since launch.  The devices are being pulled from 10 countries, including South Korea and the United States. Samsung said China is not affected by the issue because it used another battery supplier. It's unclear if models sold in China would consequently be recalled.  Samsung plans to offer Note 7 customers a new smartphone -- the Galaxy S7 or the Galaxy S7 Edge -- for free to replace the faulty product, starting next week in the U.S. The company said the full recall process will take about two weeks to complete, and the timeline will vary by country.  It will also refund the cost of Note 7-specific accessories and give Note 7 users a $25 gift card or bill credit for the inconvenience.  Target has stopped selling the phone and is working with Samsung to replace the devices already sold in stores and online. Amazon and Best Buy have also said they are no longer selling the Note 7. Best Buy customers can return or exchange the phone if they already bought one.  Mobile carriers AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint have since suspended sales, while Sprint is offering similar devices for customers to use during the recall process.  Related: Samsung is recalling the Galaxy Note 7 worldwide over battery problem  Problems with rechargeable batteries overheating are a relatively common occurrence. Earlier this year, the U.S. government recalled more than 500,000 hoverboards due to issues related to its lithium-iron battery packs getting too hot and catching on fire.  The news comes as Samsung was just starting to get its groove back. Profits have been slipping in recent years. It also comes just a few days before Apple is rumored to launch its next-generation iPhone -- likely the iPhone 7 -- at a press event.  What we still don't know  It's unclear what the recall process will entail. It's also unknown if devices in certain countries are more likely to be affected than others.  Have a Note 7? Here's what to do  The company said details about how the recall program will work will be announced shortly. In the meantime, people worried about their batteries should contact their nearest Samsung service center.   The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, which handles recalls, typically tells consumers to stop using a product immediately when it puts out a warning involving a fire hazard.  Charging should be avoided, as well: \"This is what we told consumers for the hoverboard recalls: Do not charge the device overnight or when you are not able to observe the product,\" CPSC spokesperson Carla Coolman said.  -- Jethro Mullen, K.J.

{"text": "The Federal Aviation Administration has a clear message for owners of Samsung's recalled Galaxy Note 7 smartphone: Your device is a safety hazard. Don't use it on airplanes. But it's not clear how the FAA or any U.S. airline can enforce the advisory \u2014 nor how any passenger can be certain that the person in the next seat isn't texting on or charging a phone that has been reported to catch fire.  \"Can they enforce it? Like, you going to go through and make sure you don't have anything bigger than 3 ounces and no Note 7 phones? I don't think they're going to do that,\" said airline consultant Mike Boyd.  \"There's no way of stopping somebody or searching everybody to make sure they don't have a [Note 7] on them.\"  Related: Passengers warned not to use Samsung Galaxy Note 7 on planes  Samsung (SSNLF) announced last week that it would stop selling the Note 7 and recall 2.5 million phones worldwide because of a battery problem believed to affect 0.1% of all devices sold.  On Thursday, the FAA said in a memo that it \"strongly advises\" passengers not to turn on or charge their Note 7s on board an aircraft and not to stow the phones in checked baggage.  The FAA has previously warned that fires caused by the type of batteries found in cellphones can be hard to extinguish aboard planes.  When major U.S. airlines banned unsafe hoverboards last year, some models of which were reported to catch fire and explode, enforcement was simpler. Hoverboard owners weren't allowed to bring their product on a plane.  But a cellphone is much more discreet. Flight attendants have enough trouble policing who has and hasn't switched their phones to airplane mode before takeoff. It's hard to imagine them going row by row, hunting for Note 7s.  \"There are a lot of duties that flight attendants have on board, and there has to be more staffing if this is going to be the case that they have to check every single phone for every single passenger on the plane,\" said Taylor Garland, a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants.  Related: Samsung is recalling the Galaxy Note 7 worldwide over battery problem  Some international airlines, including Singapore Airlines (SINGF), Qantas (QABSY) and Virgin Australia, have already banned use of the Note 7. Those airlines say cabin crews are making announcements on board about the ban.  But protocol in the U.S. isn't entirely clear. United (UAL) and Virgin America (VA) said they would make announcements to passengers, while Delta (DAL) said in a statement that it would comply with any FAA requirements or directives. Southwest (LUV) said it was promoting the guidelines online, but said in-flight announcements were still being discussed.  American Airlines (AAL) said it was \"in touch with the FAA\" regarding the issue, but a spokesman declined to say Friday whether crews would make announcements.  Other airlines, including JetBlue (JBLU) and Spirit (SAVE), didn't respond to requests for comment on the Note 7.  The Transportation Security Administration deferred to the FAA's statement.  Samsung has not responded to requests for comment on the use of the Note 7 on airplanes. The South Korean electronics giant is offering customers a replacement Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge and a $25 gift card or bill credit.  Related: Everything you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall  Boyd, the consultant, suggested that the FAA's advisory will be self-enforced by Note 7 owners, who will probably just decide to return their potentially defective devices. But he added that the FAA should consider telling users to avoid bringing their phones on a plane altogether.  \"The reality is, if we know it catches fire, we shouldn't have it on airplanes,\" Boyd said. \"Period.\"  Reed Alexander, Sheena Jones, Rene Marsh and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.

{"text": "Boeing's global fleet of 787 Dreamliners has been taken out of service after U.S. regulators said they were not safe to fly until a fire risk linked to the aircraft's batteries has been resolved. With 787s already grounded by heavy users Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered all U.S.-based Dreamliners out of service.  United  (UAL)Airlines, which is the only U.S. carrier flying Dreamliners, said it would pull the aircraft from service, as did Air India, Chile's LAN, Qatar Airways and LOT Polish Airlines.  Ethiopian Airlines' regional manager in South Africa, Yohannes Teklu, told CNN it had also grounded its four Dreamliners.  Boeing (BA) shares were barely higher after falling 3.4% on Wednesday. Shares had been resilient in the face of this month's negative publicity over the Dreamliner.  Related: Q&A: Dreamliner woes explained  \"Before further flight, operators of U.S.-registered, Boeing 787 aircraft must demonstrate to the Federal Aviation Administration that the batteries are safe and in compliance,\" the FAA said Wednesday. The agency added that it had alerted authorities in other countries to the problem.  Boeing CEO Jim McNerney said in a statement that the company \"is committed to supporting the FAA and finding answers as quickly as possible,\" and is working \"around the clock\" to address the issue.  \"We will be taking every necessary step in the coming days to assure our customers and the traveling public of the 787's safety, and to return the airplanes to service,\" McNerney said.  Boeing said the batteries in question are made by Japan's GS Yuasa, under a subcontract to France-based Thales.  Kyoto-based GS Yuasa said it had dispatched a team to Washington to help in the investigation -- a task that Hiroharu Nakano, a GS Yuasa spokesman, said should take at least several weeks to complete.  The timeline for bringing the planes back into service is murky. One airline, Japan Airlines, has already said it will keep its fleet grounded through at least Friday.  Michael Derchin, an analyst with CRT Capital Group, said he was \"surprised\" by the FAA's decision to ground the planes, but that he did not expect the issue to pose a long-term problem for Boeing.  \"Pretty much all new aircraft have run into some kind of teething problems,\" Derchin said. \"Once they get it under control and the planes are back in the air and no incidents occur, everybody will forget about it. But right now, they have to deal with it as quickly as possible.\"  Boeing has delivered 50 Dreamliners so far, and has more than 800 additional orders from airlines around the world that will take years to fill. The first of the long-delayed Dreamliners was put into service by All Nippon in October 2011, and the planes flew without major problems for more than a year.  But the Dreamliners have been involved in a series of incidents over the past 10 days, including a battery fire, a cracked windshield, two fuel leaks and a braking system problem. The emergency landing in Japan heightened concerns about the planes' reliability.  Airlines with Dreamliners on order have so far expressed confidence in Boeing's ability to resolve the problems. British Airways said Thursday it was committed to taking delivery of its first 787 later this year and China's Hainan Airlines said it expected the grounding to have little impact on its order for 10 Dreamliners, due to be delivered in the first half of the year.

{"text": "The iPhone 7 has arrived. Apple announced its next-generation smartphones and a slew of other products at its annual press event on Wednesday.  It kicked off with Apple CEO Tim Cook doing a little Carpool Karaoke with James Corden and Pharrell. The company recently bought a Carpool Karaoke TV series exclusively for Apple Music that will debut next year.  And then the news got underway. From two brand new iPhones to a waterproof Apple Watch, here's a look at everything Apple announced:  iPhone 7 focuses on photography  Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus come in new shades of black and have improved cameras.  It's water and dust resistant, which is different from waterproof but still an improvement over \"easily killed by water.\"  The iPhone is Apple's bread and butter. The company has sold over 1 billion of the devices since it launched in 2007, according to Cook. The latest version isn't a huge departure from the iPhone 6S, but it has a few key upgrades.   The larger iPhone has two side-by-side12-megapixel cameras. One is wide angle and one is telephoto. It gives users 2x optical zoom and 10x digital zoom. In the future, both cameras will be used at the same time to get a shallow depth-of-field effect, but that feature wasn't ready at launch. The smaller iPhone 7 still has one, lonely camera on the back.  The cameras on both phones have been updated with an optical image stabilizer, a new lens and a 12 megapixel sensor. The flash has four LEDs and can detect the flickers of artificial lighting to better compensate.  Related: Apple kicks off iPhone event with Carpool Karaoke  The Home button is now force sensitive. Instead of knowing you pressed the button because it clicked, it will vibrate. Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller said the revolutionary new button is \"creating new feelings and experiences that could not have been created before.\"  The iPhone 7 now comes in two new colors: a high gloss jet black finish and a matte black. It's also still available in gold, silver and rose gold (yes, pink). The phones will ship with iOS 10. Existing iPhones can upgrade to the new mobile OS on September 13.  The new iPhones will be available September 16 and start at $649. And, finally, the 16GB entry level version has been nixed. The new phones will come with 32GB, 128GB and 256GB of storage.  Goodbye, headphone jack  Rest in peace, iPhone headphone jack. As expected, Apple has removed the port from the iPhone 7. Wired headphones, like Apple's own EarPods, will now connect over the Lightning port instead. Apple spun the controversial decision a few ways. First, we don't lose a port, we gain improved stereo speakers! Schiller said the decision took courage -- \"the courage to move on and do something new that betters all of us.\"  To help ease the transition, Apple made an adapter that it will include with all iPhone 7 and 7 Pluses.  Related: Super Mario coming to Apple's App Store!  Apple is also introducing AirPods, wireless headphones that you will probably lose in the first month. The little wireless buds come with a white case for charging, and get up to five hours of listening time per charge. Infrared sensors detect when they're in your ears. The headphones include microphones and one-tap Siri access, powered by built-in accelerometers.  The wireless headphones will cost $159 when they come out in late October.  A new, waterproof Apple Watch  It might look the same on the outside, but Apple introduced a waterproof Apple Watch that is 50% faster and has a brighter display. It also has built in GPS. This is the first hardware update since the watch was launched last year. The new version is clumsily named Apple Watch Series 2.  The device is waterproof up to 50 meters deep. To make it waterproof, Apple changed the speaker design so after a swim, surf, or bubble bath, it can expel any water automatically. The GPS doesn't sever all ties with the iPhone, but does give the Apple Watch a slightly longer leash.  There's a new white ceramic option, which makes it look like a little iPod on your wrist. A trio of new leather Hermes bands might appeal to fashionistas. Apple is also teaming up with Nike (NKE) on a special edition, the Apple Watch Nike+, specifically for motivating and tracking runners.   The Apple Watch Series 2, which will be available in late October, will start at $369. The original watch is still available, but now has the faster processor and starts at $269. Current Apple Watch owners can pretend they have a new watch on September 13, when the new watchOS is released.  Ceramic is now the most expensive Apple Watch, and starts at $1,249. Apple is no longer selling the high-end Apple Watch Edition, an actual gold device that cost between $10,000 and $17,000.   Super Mario on iOS   There's a brand new Super Mario game coming to iOS later this year. Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto came on stage to demo Super Mario Run, which can be played with one hand and comes with a battle mode. You can compete against players around the world. It's not an Apple Car, but it was a huge crowd pleaser.   Pokemon Go comes to the Apple Watch   Pokemon Go is coming to the Apple Watch, a natural fit for the augmented reality game and fitness wearable. The game has been downloaded more that 500 million times since it was launched, according to John Hanke, founder and CEO of Niantic. Its players have walked more than 4.6 billion kilometers. The game will be available on the Apple Watch later this year.  iWork gets collaborative  The suite of work programs is adding real-time online collaboration, a la Google Docs and Microsoft Office. It works across Macs, iPads, iPhones and web versions of iWork apps.

{"text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook will do on Wednesday what he's done every fall for years. He'll take the stage in front of a room of journalists and dramatically unveil the latest version of the iPhone. This year, we're expecting a mildly upgraded pair of iPhones with some fun additions and controversial subtractions.  From the removal of the headphone jack to a new shade of black, here's a closer look at what's rumored to land on the next-generation iPhone:  Size: No big shake-ups here. Apple is expected to stick to its standard two sizes, releasing a 5.5-inch and 4.7-inch phone. Earlier this year, it announced the iPhone SE (Special Edition), a speedy 4-inch smartphone for those who prefer the more pocketable iPhone 5S. It seems too soon to update the iPhone SE, but Apple could preview a newer model to sync up the entire line.  Name game: The new devices will likely be called the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple has settled into a predictable naming cycle. The iPhone gets a fresh number every other year, and on odd years, it gets a more incremental upgrade with an S added to the end.  There's a small chance Apple could mix up its naming cycle either this year or next since the update is rumored to be more minor than usual. Apple is likely saving its big \"wow\" upgrades for next year when the iPhone turns 10. Plus, iPhone 6SS doesn't have much of a ring to it.  The event is on Sept. 7, so lets just assume Apple is clever with its scheduling.  Related: Apple plays catchup with ... everyone  Cameras: Photography is always a major focus for iPhone updates. It's one of the most popular features on the device (see the \"Shot on the iPhone 6\" ad campaign that's everywhere) and the company is always trying to find ways to one-up itself.  The larger iPhone is expected to have dual back-facing cameras, which will supposedly take better low-light photos and improve focusing. The smaller iPhone will likely get a single improved camera with a better sensor. Both devices will run the latest version of iOS 10, which includes a revamped Photos app that adds Google Photos-like image organization.  Home button update: There are a couple theories swirling about the phone's sole front-facing button. For now, Apple seems to be keeping the Home button, but it may swap out a physical movement for a tiny vibration that gives the illusion of a click. Why? Great question! It could be a way of easing people into the concept of no button at all. For next year's bigger overhaul, Apple could get rid of the button altogether, opting for an on-screen version.  General upgrades: With every new iPhone comes a battery of internal spec improvements. We're expecting a faster A10 processor and improved battery life. Apple could finally kill the too small 16GB version and bump up the minimum storage to 32GB, which means more storage for the entire line.  Headphone jack gets the boot: The industry standard 3.5mm headphone jack doesn't take up much space and works with most third-party headphones -- a plus since Apple's earbuds aren't universally loved. But that's not going to stop Apple from removing it from the device, a rumor first floated by Japanese blog Mac Otakara.  Related: Apple patent hints that iPhone 7 EarPods could be wireless  Apple is expected to remove the port from both new iPhones. Instead, headphones will need to plug into Apple's proprietary Lightning connector or work wirelessly over Bluetooth. Audiophiles unwilling to ditch their favorite headphones will probably be able to plug in using an adaptor, but that means shelling out for yet another dongle.  Waterproof: Water is the enemy of iPhone-owning parents everywhere. The iPhone 7 may become waterproof -- or at the very least, more water resistant than the iPhone 6S. The company was recently granted a patent for an editing tool intended for underwater photos, and the removal of the headphone jack will make it easier to keep water out.  Design: iPhones are always slimming down, and the next models are expected to shave off a few millimeters, possibly thanks to the absence of the headphone jack. Apple may have reached peak color excitement when it released the iPhone in rose gold (ahem, metallic pink), but it may add new matte and shiny black phones this year.  Release date: Apple typically releases new iPhones a week or so after announcing them, often on a Friday. So if you're itching to get your hands on the new gadgets, you might be able to buy one as early as September 16.

{"text": "Samsung wants to keep it simple. The company is cleaning up its line of flagship smartphones so users now have three choices: a Galaxy, a Galaxy Edge or a Galaxy Note. That's why the new Note 7, which was announced on stage at event on Tuesday, looks a lot like Samsung's previous plus-sized smartphones, the Note 5 and S6 Edge+. Coming in with a 5.7-inch Quad HD resolution display, the Note 7 is Samsung's answer to best the 5.5-inch iPhone 6S Plus.  Samsung says it skipped over the Note 6 in favor of the Note 7 name to \"unify [its] product portfolio\" and \"minimize confusion.\"  With a curved, waterproof metal and glass body, the Note 7 borrows some designs and features from the popular 5.5-inch Samsung Galaxy 7 Edge, including the always-on display and \"edge\" panel of apps.  Related: Samsung shows off Galaxy S7, S7 Edge  But under the hood, the Note 7 includes several unique features such as an iris scanner, which allows users to unlock the phone with their eyes. It also comes with a waterproof stylus, a built-in program to make GIFs and a series of features which make the device super secure. It comes in four flavors, too: black, gold, silver and blue coral.  CNNMoney got an early look at the Note 7 ahead of the announcement. Can another plus-sized smartphone stand out in an extremely saturated market? Let's take a closer look at what you can expect:  Iris scanner  The iris scanner is probably the most buzzed-about feature to land on the Note 7, but Samsung isn't the first to use it as a biometric security. Fujitsu, Alcatel and Chinese manufacturer ZTE already make phones with similar technology.  So how does it work? Samsung has added a new infrared camera that scans your eyes using infrared light emitted from the LED on the front of the phone.   You'll want to hold it about a foot away from your face, and the phone will show how to line it up your eyes. (Don't worry, you won't be surprised with a flash of light.) The data collected from the scan is saved and encrypted on the phone, and you can opt to unlock your phone or a specific app that way moving forward.  Samsung says glasses and contact lenses (particularly colored ones) can get in the way at times, but we weren't wearing either when the scanner experienced issues during our brief testing.  Although, in theory, the scanner is a novel way to keep phones locked, you'll still need to use your fingers to get to the iris scanner from the lock screen -- at which point, you could easily type in a passcode or use the fingerprint reader instead.  \"Secure Folder\"  Like BlackBerry (BBRY, Tech30) and other device manufacturers this year, Samsung is placing an emphasis on security. In addition to the iris scanner, the company also created a separate folder on the Note 7 for sensitive files.  The new \"Secure Folder\" is protected by Samsung's hardware-level KNOX security, and can be unlocked with an additional layer of protection by using a passcode, fingerprint or iris scan.  \"Symmetrical\" design  Compared to its predecessor (the Note 5), the Note 7 is an unquestionable upgrade in design. The front edges of the phone are curved like the Galaxy S7 Edge, but so are the back edges.  While this may seem like a minor adjustment, it does make the Note 7 slightly more comfortable to hold. But that difference is hard to notice because the Note 7 is also slightly bigger and heavier than the S7 Edge.  Compared to the Galaxy S6 Edge+ and Galaxy S7 Edge   The Note 7's 5.7-inch screen sits inside a body that's slightly smaller but thicker and heavier than the Galaxy S6 Edge+.  It's noticeably larger and heavier than the Galaxy S7 Edge, which has a 5.5-inch screen, but not by much.  The Note 7 comes with a standard base of 64 GB of expandable storage -- unlike the Galaxy S6 Edge+, which only came with 32 GB or 64 GB of fixed storage. The Galaxy S7 Edge currently only comes with 32 GB of expandable storage. Meanwhile, the latest smartphone features a 3500 mAh battery, compared to 3600 on the S7 Edge and 3000 mAh on the S6 Edge+ and Note 5.   GIF-maker  Samsung has a knack for taking popular digital habits and baking them into its phones. Last year, it made it easier for people to launch live-streams from their Note 5 via a feature directly through the camera and this year, the focus is on GIFs.  With a Note 7, users will be able to take clips from YouTube or their own videos to create shareable GIFs without downloading any extra software. This will require users to use the \"Smart Select\" feature through the S Pen stylus.  Waterproof writing  Just like the Galaxy S7 Edge, the Note 7 is waterproof for about a half an hour in up to 5 feet of water. And yes, because the Note 7 features Samsung's S Pen, the stylus is just as waterproof.  The combination means that if you ever need to, you could write notes underwater and pin it to your lock screen.   Pricing and availability   Pre-orders for the Note 7 begin Wednesday. Carriers expected to start selling on August 19.  T-Mobile  (TMUS)and Sprint (S) customers can buy the device for $850, while AT&T (T, Tech30) has it priced at $880, spread over its payment plans.  Verizon (VZ, Tech30)'s retail price falls in the middle at $864.

{"text": "Samsung released new guidance for Galaxy Note 7 users on Saturday: Turn off the phone and bring it in for a replacement phone. The message comes a week after Samsung announced it would immediately stop selling the phone and replace the 2.5 million it had already sold.  Samsung (SSNLF) is not calling what it is doing a recall and instead labels it a \"global replacement program.\" But, let's face it, it's a recall. Both Verizon (VZ, Tech30) and AT&T (T, Tech30) are calling it a recall on their websites.  Samsung didn't respond to CNNMoney's request for comment. So we reached out to the U.S. call center and a representative said Note 7 users should power off the phone and bring it back to the retail location where it was purchased. Customers must bring the phones with them to receive a refund or a different model.  Here's what you should know:  What's the problem?  There's a risk that the Note 7 can catch fire while charging due to problems with the battery. The issue is only believed to affect 0.1% of all devices.  Samsung said last week that it had found only 24 phones to be defective.  In the U.S., the Consumer Product Safety Commission urged users to power down their phones and said it would be providing guidance about an official recall \"as soon as possible.\"  The \"exchange program\" comes as rival Apple unveiled its new iPhone 7 on Wednesday. Samsung is the world's biggest selling smartphone maker.  The Note 7 went on sale in August.  What countries are affected?  Sales of the Note 7 were halted last week in 10 countries: the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, the UAE and Korea.  However, notices of the return program were posted on Samsung's global website as well as those of several countries not listed in initial statements about the battery problem.  Phones in China don't appear to be affected because they have a different battery.  What should you do?  Samsung \"strongly\" advised customers to power down their phones and participate in the program in a statement posted on their global website.  Customers are advised to contact their local call centers or visit the retail location where the phone was purchased. In the U.S., customers can call 1-800-SAMSUNG or 1-800-726-7864.  Customers have the option to replace their phone with the Galaxy S7, the Galaxy S7 Edge or a different device and receive reimbursement for the difference.  For Note 7 holders who would prefer to wait for a new model, they will receive a Samsung J Series loaner phone until the new model is released. New Note 7 phones will need CPSC approval before they can be released in the U.S.  Note 7 accessories can also be returned for a refund and Samsung is issuing a $25 gift card, in-store credit or bill credit to users for the inconvenience.  Can I take it on a plane?  Note 7 users can take their phones on board airplanes but the phones must be powered off and cannot be connected to a charging device.  The phones should be carried onto the plane and not stowed in checked luggage, according to guidance from airlines around the world.

{"text": "NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has closed its investigation into a possible fire risk in Chevrolet Volt cars after finding little risk of fires in real-world scenarios, the agency said Friday.\"Based on the available data, NHTSA does not believe that Chevy Volts or other electric vehicles pose a greater risk of fire than gasoline-powered vehicles,\" the agency said in its statement. The investigation had started as a result of fires that occurred one to three weeks after government side-impact crash tests. The fires were sparked after the cars had been slowly rotated as part of a post-test procedure causing battery coolant to come into contact with circuit boards.  The batteries were still charged at the time.General Motors, which makes the Volt, had announced earlier this month that it was voluntarily making changes to the cars to reduce any possible danger of battery fires. About 8,000 Volts are on the road today. GM said it is proud of the technological innovation the Volt represents and appreciates the confidence Volt customers continued to provide it during the investigation.  As part of the changes announced earlier, GM (GM, Fortune 500) dealers will add an additional metal structure around the battery pack to more evenly distribute crash forces.Dealers will begin doing the work in February.GM is not calling that action a \"recall.\" It says it's a \"customer satisfaction campaign\" since it was never required by NHTSA.  \"We're taking these steps to provide peace of mind to our customers,\" Barra said.NHTSA engineers crash-tested a Volt fitted with GM's proposed changes on Dec. 22.

{"text": "It's the question on everyone's mind: Are we in a tech bubble? San Francisco itself is one giant bubble, says one engineer based in New York City.  Lawrence Finn, an engineer at ad tech firm AppNexus, wrote about a recent trip to San Francisco on Friday. He says too much money and demand for engineering talent has led to a city that is \"expensive and just weird.\"  The post generated a lot of fervor on tech discussion board Hacker News, as people debated the veracity of Finn's findings.  Some startup ideas are just plain dumb  \"Sure, some startups solve legitimate problems and have a lot of talent and chance for success, but a majority of them are silly,\" wrote Finn. \"A company to 'disrupt the banana hammock ordering process' cannot possibly do well, yet someone invested money into it and it is paying employees.\"  Who's responsible? Those with the ideas, yes, but also those enabling these companies.  \"It feels to me that VCs and angel investors are pumping money into SF. This money helps fund many tiny crappy startups,\" he said.  Related: Reality check for tech workers: They may not strike it rich  One commenter on Hacker News agreed: \"I've had the (figurative) banana hammock recruiter call me, too, and it's shocking to me how many people are repeating the mistakes of the '90s boom.\"  The demand for engineers is creating a troubling phenomenon  Finn touches on two points here. He notes that there are so many roles for engineers, that they can't possibly all be talented. He says just the fact that they're getting hired -- and paid a lot of money -- doesn't reflect their actual skill level.  Finn says many are receiving certificate degrees, but being \"quality,\" requires \"great mentorship and at the job learning,\" things he does not believe most receive.  The high pay, and high demand, for engineers also results in \"particularly spoiled\" employees, he said.  \"They can take an arbitrary sabbatical from work, they cannot be told no or reprimanded, and they make so much money that they can just take random breaks from employment to chill,\" said Finn.  Related: Are there dead unicorns on the horizon?  Ironically, he is on sabbatical from AppNexus, which is valued at $1.2 billion, according to CB Insights. The company is one of tech's \"unicorns,\" the term for privately-held companies worth $1 billion or more. A sabbatical is one perk that AppNexus offers its employees after five years of service.

{"text": "Japanese auto parts manufacturer Takata ignored years of warnings over faulty airbags, and even put crucial safety inspections on hold due to cost concerns, according to a new report from congressional investigators. The report, written by Senate Commerce Committee staff, for Sen. Bill Nelson, the panel's ranking Democrat, sheds new light on Takata's response to an airbag safety problem that eventually resulted in the largest auto recall in history.  Kevin Kennedy, an executive vice president at Takata, is scheduled to testify before the committee on Tuesday. The company disputed the congressional report, saying that it contained a \"number of inaccuracies\" and relies on documents that have been \"taken out of context and characterized in ways that creates a false impression.\"  Earlier this year, Takata doubled its initial recall of faulty airbags. That brought the number of recalled cars to 34 million -- or nearly one in every seven cars on U.S. roads. The recall was made more complex following news that some cars that had already undergone service would need a second airbag replacement.  Related: Takata announces largest auto recall ever  Airbags made by the company have been found to explode and send shrapnel into the face and body, mainly in the event of an accident. So far, authorities have linked the airbags to seven deaths in the U.S. and one in Malaysia.  \"The more evidence we see, the more it paints a troubling picture of a manufacturer that lacked concern,\" Nelson said in a statement. The report concludes that had Takata \"maintained a more robust culture of safety, it is likely that many of these defects could have been discovered much sooner.\"  Among the most serious allegations contained in the report is that Takata halted global safety inspections from 2009 to 2011 -- after Honda had initiated select airbag recalls -- in order to save money.  The committee cites internal emails to support the claim, including an April 2011 message from a Takata senior vice president which noted that \"global safety audits had stopped for financial reasons for last 2 years.\"  Takata, in response, said the emails are about the safe handling of pyrotechnic materials by employees, and are not related to product quality or safety.  Related: Takata airbag victims looked like they had been shot or stabbed  The committee report also faults Takata for failing to completely identify why the airbags are defective, saying that \"significant questions still remain,\" even as the company produces replacement parts that are being used in the recall.  \"Takata is currently producing hundreds of thousands of replacement inflators each month that may not completely eliminate the risk of airbag rupture,\" the report says. Still, \"it is best to continue replacing the old, defective inflators as quickly as possible -- even though there is a distinct possibility that some of these replacements will eventually also be recalled.\"  The report also criticizes the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a U.S. regulator, for failing to respond effectively to the crisis.  Had the agency \"promptly undertaken more aggressive steps to investigate the Takata airbag ruptures, it is possible that this defect could have been addressed years earlier,\" the report says.  -- CNN's Junko Ogura contributed reporting.

{"text": "Apple may have infuriated many customers by eliminating the 3.5mm headphone jack in the latest iPhone, but there is a consolation prize. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) is killing off the much criticized 16GB option for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus after years of complaints that this entry-level version offers far too little space.  The company announced at its big press event on Wednesday that new iPhones will start at 32GB for $649, followed by a 128GB option and a 256GB model.  The original iPhone, released in 2007, offered a 4GB option. By the time the iPhone 4 came out in 2010, the lowest storage option was 16GB.  For a time that was a luxury. But half a decade later, the affordable 16GB option for new iPhones became more impractical for customers.  The number of iPhone apps available to download ballooned during those years and the size limit for each app doubled to 4GB, or as those with the 16GB iPhone would call it, storage bankruptcy.  Streaming services like Spotify, while theoretically removing the need to clog up your phone with downloads, nonetheless continued to take up space through offline storage and cached music.  Related: Apple has the 'courage' to eliminate headphone jack  Perhaps most importantly though, Apple encouraged customers to take more and better quality pictures on their phones, to the detriment of their storage space.  Apple launched increasingly storage-intensive features like Live Photos and 4K videos as part of a bid to cement the iPhone's position as the leading smartphone for everyday photographers. But it didn't increase the baseline amount of storage for the phones.  For Apple, the 16GB option was a trick to keep the entry cost for the iPhone low. Now Apple has decided it can offer the 32GB model for the same price. There was much rejoicing.     Next up on the wish list: killing the 32GB model.

{"text": "If you're saving for retirement, one of the cardinal rules is: \"Don't touch your 401(k) until you retire.\" Eric Schneider followed it diligently during his 25 years selling commercial insurance. But two years ago, he emptied his nest egg to launch Headrush Roasters Coffee & Tea in Kansas City, Mo.  \"I took a big risk, but I don't regret it at all,\" said Schneider, 49, who co-owns the business with his wife Nancy.  Schneider left his six-figure job in 2010 with $250,000 in his 401(k) and $100,000 in savings. In 2011, he found a vacant building that he thought would be perfect for his coffee shop and roastery. He hoped to lease it, but the owner only wanted to sell.  \"I'm a big believer in no debt,\" he said. \"I had paid off my house, my cars. I didn't want to take out a loan to buy the building.\"  Related: Google unveils marketing platform for business owners  As he researched financing options, he came across ROBS, or Rollovers as Business Startups. These allow people to use the money in their 401(k) to start a business (or buy an existing one) without paying taxes on the withdrawn funds or getting hit with an early withdrawal penalty.  The process can be pretty complicated, however. First, you must incorporate a business and open a new 401(k) plan under it. Then you roll your existing 401(k) funds into the new plan. Since both accounts are tax-exempt, you avoid taking the tax hit.  As owner of the new company, you can now direct what the 401(k) invests in. With ROBS, the new company typically issues shares that you can purchase using money from the 401(k). You're then free to use the cash from that purchase for operational expenses (although owners must pay their own salaries out of revenue, not from the 401(k) funds).  While the IRS does not consider ROBS an \"abusive tax-avoidance transaction,\" the agency calls the arrangement \"questionable\" and has strict compliance standards to avoid penalties (and audits).  Related: I opened 40 businesses in 35 years  Because the process was so involved, Schneider signed up with Bellevue, Wash.-based Guidant Financial, which is among a handful of financing firms that help entrepreneurs set up ROBS.  Guidant began offering ROBS in 2004, and it has become the firm's signature product.  Cofounder David Nilssen said his firm has had 9,000 entrepreneurs take advantage of the financing option, and 80% of them are still in business after four years.   But the firm's services don't come cheap. Guidant charges clients $4,995 initially and $119 a month for advisory services after that. (While that's not required, the complexity of the arrangement means most entrepreneurs keep the accounts with Guidant to ensures regular compliance.)  \"This option isn't for everyone,\" said Nilssen. \"There's a niche market for it, and individuals who've accumulated enough assets in life are more open to it.\"  He said their ROBS clients are typically between 40 and 60 years old, own their own homes and have advanced degrees with a combined household income of over $75,000.  \"60% of them are first-time entrepreneurs who are choosing a second career,\" he said.  Still, Stuart Ritter, senior financial planner and vice president with T. Rowe Price, said ROBS can be risky.  \"With ROBS, you're putting 100% of your retirement saving into a single security,\" he said. \"People really have to think about this.\"  Related: The best nations for women entrepreneurs  It can also be difficult for entrepreneurs to rebuild their nest egg.  Chrissy and Mike Mayhew opened Beach House Miracles, a renovation firm, in Ocean View, Del., in 2008. They didn't have capital so they funded the startup using $100,000 from their 401(k).  Today, they have five employees and logged $1 million in revenue last year. But even though the business has been successful, they have yet to start contributing to their retirement plan.  Still, they're comfortable with their decision. \"The gamble paid off for us,\" Chrissy said.  Do you have what it takes to be rich?  Meanwhile, Schneider was able to buy the building with the $250,000 from his 401(k). He spent his $100,000 in savings on remodeling and equipment and opened Headrush in 2012.  If he ever sells the business, he'll put the money back into the 401(k) plan. If the business fails, he won't have to pay a penalty but he also won't have his retirement cushion.  So far, things are going well.  After two years in business, the company is set to log a profit this year. It has seven employees and is looking to open more locations.  \"It's been a win-win for me, the government and the economy,\" Schneider said. \"I've created a business, the government is collecting taxes on my business and I'm hiring people.\" ", "date": "June 23, 2014: 6:08 AM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/23/smallbusiness/startup-funding-401k/index.html", "author": "Parija Kavilanz"},

{"text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook will do on Wednesday what he's done every fall for years. He'll take the stage in front of a room of journalists and dramatically unveil the latest version of the iPhone. This year, we're expecting a mildly upgraded pair of iPhones with some fun additions and controversial subtractions.  From the removal of the headphone jack to a new shade of black, here's a closer look at what's rumored to land on the next-generation iPhone:  Size: No big shake-ups here. Apple is expected to stick to its standard two sizes, releasing a 5.5-inch and 4.7-inch phone. Earlier this year, it announced the iPhone SE (Special Edition), a speedy 4-inch smartphone for those who prefer the more pocketable iPhone 5S. It seems too soon to update the iPhone SE, but Apple could preview a newer model to sync up the entire line.  Name game: The new devices will likely be called the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple has settled into a predictable naming cycle. The iPhone gets a fresh number every other year, and on odd years, it gets a more incremental upgrade with an S added to the end.  There's a small chance Apple could mix up its naming cycle either this year or next since the update is rumored to be more minor than usual. Apple is likely saving its big \"wow\" upgrades for next year when the iPhone turns 10. Plus, iPhone 6SS doesn't have much of a ring to it.  The event is on Sept. 7, so lets just assume Apple is clever with its scheduling.  Related: Apple plays catchup with ... everyone  Cameras: Photography is always a major focus for iPhone updates. It's one of the most popular features on the device (see the \"Shot on the iPhone 6\" ad campaign that's everywhere) and the company is always trying to find ways to one-up itself.  The larger iPhone is expected to have dual back-facing cameras, which will supposedly take better low-light photos and improve focusing. The smaller iPhone will likely get a single improved camera with a better sensor. Both devices will run the latest version of iOS 10, which includes a revamped Photos app that adds Google Photos-like image organization.  Home button update: There are a couple theories swirling about the phone's sole front-facing button. For now, Apple seems to be keeping the Home button, but it may swap out a physical movement for a tiny vibration that gives the illusion of a click. Why? Great question! It could be a way of easing people into the concept of no button at all. For next year's bigger overhaul, Apple could get rid of the button altogether, opting for an on-screen version.  General upgrades: With every new iPhone comes a battery of internal spec improvements. We're expecting a faster A10 processor and improved battery life. Apple could finally kill the too small 16GB version and bump up the minimum storage to 32GB, which means more storage for the entire line.  Headphone jack gets the boot: The industry standard 3.5mm headphone jack doesn't take up much space and works with most third-party headphones -- a plus since Apple's earbuds aren't universally loved. But that's not going to stop Apple from removing it from the device, a rumor first floated by Japanese blog Mac Otakara.  Related: Apple patent hints that iPhone 7 EarPods could be wireless  Apple is expected to remove the port from both new iPhones. Instead, headphones will need to plug into Apple's proprietary Lightning connector or work wirelessly over Bluetooth. Audiophiles unwilling to ditch their favorite headphones will probably be able to plug in using an adaptor, but that means shelling out for yet another dongle.  Waterproof: Water is the enemy of iPhone-owning parents everywhere. The iPhone 7 may become waterproof -- or at the very least, more water resistant than the iPhone 6S. The company was recently granted a patent for an editing tool intended for underwater photos, and the removal of the headphone jack will make it easier to keep water out.  Design: iPhones are always slimming down, and the next models are expected to shave off a few millimeters, possibly thanks to the absence of the headphone jack. Apple may have reached peak color excitement when it released the iPhone in rose gold (ahem, metallic pink), but it may add new matte and shiny black phones this year.  Release date: Apple typically releases new iPhones a week or so after announcing them, often on a Friday. So if you're itching to get your hands on the new gadgets, you might be able to buy one as early as September 16.

The country's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said in a statement on Friday that it would not prevent passengers from bringing the phone onto aircraft, or stop them from charging the device during flight.  Samsung said a week ago that it was halting sales of the Note 7 and would recall 2.5 million devices in 10 countries, including South Korea and the U.S. The company will replace them with new Note 7 phones.

U.S. federal transportation rules permit the lithium batteries found in cellphones and similar electronic devices to be checked or carried on board planes.

It's the near-term future today's hackers are warning about.  Most people aren't aware their cars are already high-tech computers. And now we're networking them by giving them wireless connectivity. Yet there's a danger to turning your car into a smartphone on wheels: It makes them a powerful target for hackers.  Interviews with automakers, suppliers and security advisers reveal a major problem with the new wave of \"connected\" cars: The inside of your car has ancient technology that presents a security risk.   \"The protocol and internal parts of the car were never meant to be connected to anything,\" said Joe Klein, a researcher at security firm Disrupt6.  Cars' computers were built safely enough back in the 1990s, when the car was a closed box. But their architecture won't hold up as we hook them up to the Internet.  Related story: Tesla car doors can be hacked  Consider the level of complexity of modern day cars -- and the chance for a screw up. The space ship that put humans on the moon, Apollo 11, had 145,000 lines of computer code. The Android operating system has 12 million. A modern car? Easily 100 million lines of code.  \"Auto manufacturers are not up to speed,\" said Ed Adams, a researcher at Security Innovation, a company that tests the safety of automobiles. \"They're just behind the times. Car software is not built to the same standards as, say, a bank application. Or software coming out of Microsoft.\"  The nightmare scenario: Hackers access your car's core controls by breaching its Internet-connected entertainment system and tamper with your brakes.  Hackers have already proven that scenario can happen. Security engineers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek demonstrated last year how they could hijack control of a car by connecting laptops to the dashboard.  But cars are going wireless. The next generation of Audi and Tesla (TSLA) automobiles are connected to the AT&T (T) network. Wires won't be needed to hack them.  Related: Cybersecurity: How safe are you?  Meanwhile, there's a growing potential for car malware. Makers of \"infotainment\" systems -- dashboards that function like a tablet -- are racing to add fun apps. But if automobiles' internal electronics remain insecure, downloading a malicious app to your car could spell big trouble. That's why auto suppliers are taking initiative.  Harman (HAR) makes Bluetooth audio devices that end up in BMWs, Hyundais, Mercedes-Benzes and others. The company is adding its own layers of security by using software to virtually separate the entertainment system from the car's network. It raises the bar of difficulty for a hacker to use a music app to worm his way into your steering controls.  Sachin Lawande leads Harman's infotainment division and justifies its initiative: \"The assumption we're making is that it'll take a while for the auto industry to move to a more secure internal network than what we have today.\"  Continental, one of the world's three major auto parts suppliers, is partnering with IBM (IBM) and Cisco (CSCO) to make firewalls that control the information flow between the car's devices. Until it gets security all figured out, the German company is holding back from adding full Internet connectivity features, such as real-time information from the engine that alerts the local car shop ahead of time.  \"Without having a good firewall or security in place, I can't go to the auto manufacturer and say, 'Let me have access to information from engine management,'\" said Tejas Desai, Continental's head of interior electronics for North America.  Related story: Half of American adults hacked this year  For their part, car manufacturers are working on these problems too.  Ford (F) hardware has built-in firewalls to prevent malicious tampering, and the company has a team of noble hackers constantly probing for weaknesses.  Toyota (TM) does all that too, plus it embeds security chips in the tiny computers throughout the car, narrowing how they communicate and lessening the chance of outsider interference. The company even has forward-thinking plans this year to visit the world's largest hacker conference, Black Hat.  It should be no surprise that Tesla (TSLA) is ahead of the pack. The Model S is the most advanced and connected car currently available. It's worth noting the company's mature approach to addressing vulnerabilities. Instead of hunting down hackers who spot weaknesses, they reward them with an \"Information Security\" badge that works like a Willy Wonka golden ticket, granting exclusive access to Tesla's factory in Fremont, Calif. The company recently sent one to a British hacker who goes by Jon of Bitquark.  But there remains a glaring, three-prong problem beneath all of these security approaches. The car's many little computers will continue to be connected to one another. All auto makers are moving toward Internet-connected cars. And no one is willing to physically separate the core controls from the car's wireless communication hub.  That's partly because federal regulators will soon demand that cars automatically relay information wirelessly to one another as part of the U.S. government's vehicle-to-vehicle communication program. Those car-to-car messages will one day be able to engage brakes -- or your steering wheel.  If decades of computer hacking has shown us anything, it's that smart people will find a way to break in and bounce around.  Scott Morrison, who oversees automotive app engineering at CA Technologies (CA), acknowledged all of these problems exist and said the industry knows what's on the line.  \"They're very aware they don't get second chances on this, so they're taking it very seriously,\" he said.

{"text": "Apple has been granted a patent for new EarPod headphones, which could hint at what's going to ship with the new iPhone 7. The new patent, granted on Tuesday, is for headphones that connect to an iPhone both wirelessly and with a wire. They can be used without being plugged in, but have a connector that lets you magnetically attach a cord to the earbuds and plug the other end into a jack.  The EarPod design follows rumors that the iPhone 7 could ship without a headphone jack. Many people assumed that Apple would design new EarPods that would wirelessly connect to iPhones using Bluetooth. Some believe they will connect to the iPhone's Lightning port.  But headphone jacks aren't going away everywhere. Not every music-playing device has Bluetooth.  So Apple has patented a unique concept: hybrid, detachable headphones. They're wireless when you want them to be and they have a wire when you need one.  Apple's patent likely isn't exactly what will ship with the iPhone 7. The patent shows a set of headphones that require a cord to be plugged into a headphone jack -- that cord can be separated from the earbuds and wirelessly transmit the signal to the detached headphones.  But the patent was initially filed in March 2011, and technology has evolved since then. Headphones that connect wirelessly but can also be plugged in would represent a pretty neat innovation.  Related: 5 ways to expand your iPhone's storage beyond 16 GB  Apple last updated its EarPods in 2012, so they're due for an upgrade.  Rumors started swirling in November about Apple dropping the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, and several Apple suppliers have reportedly lent credence to that notion.  The current iPhone 6S is 7.1 mm thick. So if Apple wants to slim down the iPhone 7, it's has to contend with the 3.5 mm jack. It's running out of real estate.

{"text": "Samsung showed off a slew of new gadgets at CES that it plans to sell this year. Company executives also invited business partners from Time Warner Cable and MasterCard to join them on stage to present the latest lineup of Samsung consumer electronics. The theme this year? Devices that are all meant to work together.  Here's a look at the coolest products announced:  1. Smart TVs that let you switch between cable channels and streaming media services without having to change inputs or use separate remote controls. The TVs will integrate programming into one \"channel guide\" so you can see what's new on Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) as easily as you can see what's on your traditional channels.  Samsung's new TVs will also instantly recognize a game console when you plug it in and show you new video games from that company. The TVs can also control other Internet connected gadgets so that you can see who's at your door and turn on your lights.  One last thing in this category: Samsung will also sell \"the world's first bezel-less curved design\" TV, as well as ultra high-definition screens that will be able to display extremely levels of light contrast.   2. A new ultra high-definition Blu-Ray player -- the first of its kind -- will go on sale in March, around the same time that movies like \"The Martian,\" \"The Peanuts Movie,\" and \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" will be available in the format.   3. The \"Family Hub Refrigerator\" is actually pretty cool. Yes, this is the same connected fridge that caught flak for looking like a giant tablet. But there are some interesting features. The touchscreen can mirror what you're watching on TV in the living room, stream music, control other connected gadgets, and let you order groceries directly from the door using a new app from MasterCard (MA).  The fridge also takes a picture of your shelves every time you close the door. And there's an app so you can see the photo the next time you're at the grocery store.   4. A \"Pro\" version of its Galaxy tablet called the Galaxy TabPro S is expected to be the thinnest (0.25 inches) and lightest (1.5 pounds) tablet-laptop on the market. Like Apple (AAPL, Tech30) and Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), Samsung is going after people who want something they can use at work and at home, when all they want is to watch Netflix. The new Galaxy TabPro S will run Windows 10.   5. Samsung Gear S2 smartwatches will work with iOS devices later this year. And there will be two new colors to choose from in February: rose gold and platinum.   6. The new 13.3-inch Notebook 9 will be super thin and weigh less than two pounds.   And lastly, there are rumors that with the new Galaxy S7 smartphone, Samsung will bring back the microSD slot, make the device water resistant, and add a larger capacity battery.

{"text": "Apple doesn't need to be first. It didn't make the first smartphone, the first smartwatch, or the first tablet computer. But there is an expectation that its products will be the best.  Now, the company is going after its competitors by brazenly imitating their successes. During Monday's big preview of new software coming out this fall, Apple announced a lot of familiar-sounding features. Some were minor, like opening up Maps to developers (hello, Waze), or adding \"widgets\" to the iOS lock screen (good day, Android).  Here are some of Apple's (AAPL, Tech30) big product announcements and how they compare to what's already out there.  Photos, but like Google Photos  Google Photos is only a year old, but the cloud-based photo backup service has drawn praise for unlimited storage (for compressed images anyway) and some very clever automatic organizing features. Apple is adding extremely similar bells and whistles to its Photos apps on iOS and the Mac. It will have face detection, object and location recognition, and comb through older images to create \"Memories,\" which become automatically edited videos.  Related: Everything Apple announced at WWDC 2016  How it's different: Apple's angle here is privacy. It does all the computations (11 billion per photo) on-device instead of in the cloud. The reason, they say, is to give users more privacy and control over their own data. Since it's not in the business of selling things like targeted ads, Apple is less interested in an individual's data than a company like Google (GOOG).  There are some tradeoffs. It's unclear how far back the Memories can actually go since many people upload their old images to a service like iCloud or Dropbox to free up memory on mobile devices. And Apple doesn't offer unlimited backups.  Siri, but like Alexa, Cortana, Google Assistant  Apple is opening up Siri on iOS so developers can integrate their services with the voice assistant, following in the steps of Cortana and Alexa. It's also coming to the Mac, just like Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) did with Cortana and Google did with OK Google, though that version won't be available to developers just yet. And Apple is adding Siri controls for smart-home devices to the Apple TV, which will make it somewhat competitive with Amazon's Echo and Google's forthcoming Home speakers.  How it's different: Apple has a lot of experience with the technology and a huge pool of users. It also already has strong relationships with major developers, many of whom are likely excited to finally tap Siri's powers.  But the company is proceeding with caution and only letting six types of apps use Siri. It leaves music, mapping, weather and many others out. This keeps Apple's own apps from being overshadowed, but could also strangle innovation and annoy people who just want Siri to play a song on Spotify.  Messages, but like What'sApp, Snapchat, Facebook Messenger  The default messaging app for iOS was pretty basic, with text and SMS messages on a clean white background, and an emoji keyboard available for people who hate typing out \"taco.\"  Now Apple is adding the following things kids will have to explain to their parents: animated backgrounds, enlarged emojis, gifs, stickers, animated text bubbles, doodles (perplexingly branded \"Digital Touch\"), and invisible images that only appear when you rub them and totally won't be used for anything naughty.  It's following in the footsteps of pretty much every popular messaging app: Facebook's WhatsApp and Messenger, Snapchat, and popular Asian chat apps like Line. Google is even working on its own chat platform called Allo.  How it's different: Unlike the popular third-party messaging apps, Messages is only on Apple devices. That means a lot of the new features won't translate when you're chatting with someone on an Android device. Apple is also showing a bit of restraint and not going after this year's most overblown tech trend, bots.   Voicemail, but like Google Voice  When the first iPhone was released in 2007, Apple said it had \"Visual Voicemail,\" but that just meant you could see a list of all voicemails. Now it will finally live up to the name and take a stab at transcribing voicemail messages into text. It's a service Google Voice has offered for years, though they are often fantastically incorrect.  How it's different: Google's surrealist translations leave a lot of room for improvement. If Apple has improved on the technology at all, the feature is sure to be a hit with anyone who hates listening to rambling messages. Unfortunately, it won't be included in the first version of iOS 10, so we'll have to wait to test it.

{"text": "It's been long rumored the next-generation iPhone could be partially waterproof -- and a newly published Apple patent just added potential credibility to those claims. The company was recently granted a patent by the US Patent and Trademark Office that hints at its possible plans for waterproof or water-resistant gadgets. The patent highlights editing tools that could be used for underwater photography to ensure those scenes don't have \"undesirable tints\".  This means underwater pictures could stay vivid and maintain a blue water hue.  While many Apple patents reference concepts that don't ever see the light of day, this is its latest in a string that demonstrates it is keen to develop gadgets like iPhones that can be used underwater.  For example, Apple (AAPL, Tech30) was approved for a patent earlier this year for \"submersion detection circuitry\" designed to help gadgets sense when they've been dipped into water or other liquids.  Meanwhile, in late 2015, Apple was awarded a patent for a \"protective barrier\" that covers ports to make the area water-resistant. There's also the patent published in March 2015 that highlights how Apple has considered special coatings and seals to shield \"electronic components from moisture.\"  Simply put, there's a clear trend with all this paperwork.   Related: Stunning underwater Olympic shots now taken by robots  The tech giant is expected to announce the iPhone 7 in September. In addition to incorporating waterproof features, Apple's next-generation smartphone is rumored to ditch the headphone jack, a move that would make the phone less vulnerable to water damage.  Although the existing iPhone 6S isn't a waterproof device, CNNMoney previously dunked it in a vase of water for five minutes as a part of a test. Remarkably, the iPhone 6S continued to operate while submerged and functioned for about 10 minutes after it was removed.  Eventually, the screen went white, stopped working and shut off for good.  Related: Apple's Tim Cook says life at the top can be 'lonely'  It wouldn't come as a big surprise for Apple to add waterproof features to its next iPhone; after all, it's behind the curve on the trend.  Samsung has offered water-resistant products for years, and the new Samsung Galaxy Note 7 features a waterproof metal and glass body, and a waterproof stylus. The Note 7, just like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, is waterproof for about a half an hour in up to 5 feet of water.

{"text": "Bad news renters: Don't expect much relief in 2016. Next year, experts predict rents will rise faster than inflation, increasing around 3%-5% on a national level.  \"We are already in a rental affordability crisis, and 2016 won't let up,\" said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.  In the years following the financial crisis, vacancy rates have plummeted as demand for renting rose, sending rents soaring.  Related: Half of all renters can't afford the rent  But here's the good news: While rents are expected to continue to climb next year, the pace will start to slow in some areas.  Prices in the country's hottest rental markets, like San Francisco, Boston and New York City, are expected to plateau, according to Devin O'Brien, head of strategic marketing at rental platform Zumper.  Spillover from those hot markets, however, will push prices higher in surrounding areas as renters get priced out. For instance, O'Brien expects price gains in Oakland to outpace those in San Francisco in 2016. And rents in Cambridge will see a major rise as renters seek a cheaper alternative to Boston. He's also expecting strong rental growth in Austin, Dallas, Houston and Miami.  Related: Not buying a home was my smartest financial move  While new construction will bring new rental units on the market, it isn't likely to keep up with growing demand. Vacancy rates are so low in many places that it'll take at least a year for supply to catch up to demand, according to research from Yardi Matrix. Plus, new inventory tends to be high-end, which won't be much help with rental affordability.  Rising mortgage rates could also push rents higher. The Federal Reserve is expected to start raising interest rates for the first time in nine years, which could keep people in the rental market longer. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs, boxing out potential buyers and sending rents even higher.  Paying more toward monthly rent makes it harder to save for a down payment and eventually become a homeowner, which could force people to stay in the rental market longer.  Are you a baby boomer in the rental market or looking to make the move from a homeowner to a renter? We want to hear from you.

{"text": "A funny thing happened at Apple's big event on Wednesday. It started off more like an ad for Nintendo than it did for Apple. The maker of iEverything announced early on in its latest iPhone presentation that a new Super Mario game (about the iconic plumber, not ECB chief Mario Draghi) would be available in Apple's iOS store later this year.  Tim Cook introduced Super Mario -- and Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto -- to raucous applause. Miyamoto showed off the \"Super Mario Run\" game, which had a retro 80s feel, to an adoring crowd.  Wall Street cheered the news as well. Nintendo (NTDOY)'s U.S. listed stock closed up 29% . (That's a lot of 1 UP mushrooms!)  Apple (AAPL, Tech30) also said Nintendo's uber-popular Pokemon Go mobile augmented reality game would be coming to the next version of the Apple Watch as well. Nintendo is an owner of Niantic, the private company that developed Pokemon Go.

{"text": "Walmart is taking a big stake in a prominent Chinese e-commerce company. But it's not Alibaba. The Arkansas-based retail giant said Monday it will buy about 5% of Alibaba rival JD.com -- an investment worth about $1.5 billion. JD is the second-largest retailer in China.  Shares of JD (JD) were up more than 8% before they were halted ahead of the official news announcement. (The Wall Street Journal originally reported about the deal earlier Monday morning.) The stock was still up around 6% once it resumed trading.  Walmart's stock was up a bit too Monday, but it was lagging the broader market's larger gains. That may be because the news could be viewed as a sign that Walmart is sort of throwing in the towel on China.  As part of the deal, Walmart is also selling its own Chinese e-commerce site -- Yihaodian -- to JD. Walmart (WMT) said that it will continue to sell goods on Yihaodian and that it will work closely with JD on ways to grow the Yihaodian brand.  Walmart will also set up a flagship store for its Sam's Club China warehouse unit on JD's marketplace.  \"We're excited about teaming up with such a strong leader in JD.com, and the potential that this new relationship creates for customers in China, as well as for our businesses,\" said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon in a release.  \"We also look forward to offering customers a tremendous number of quality imported products not previously widely available in China through Walmart and Sam's Club,\" McMillon added.  JD CEO Richard Liu said his company would further develop Yihaodian. He noted that Sam's Clubs in China have already been popular in several Chinese cities -- particularly with wealthier Chinese consumers.  Related: Alibaba's Jack Ma says fake goods are better than the real thing  And Liu appeared to take a jab at rival Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) -- which has had a problem with counterfeit goods on its many e-commerce sites.  \"JD.com's reputation for authentic products and superior customer experience make it an outstanding home for these iconic businesses to reach hundreds of millions more customers in China,\" he said.  Alibaba investors appeared to take the news in stride. The stock rose 2% on Monday.  And while Alibaba shares are still down 3% so far this year, Alibaba has held up a lot better than JD as investors worry about the health of China's economy.  JD has lost about a third of its value so far this year.  The company recently reported a bigger-than-expected loss for the first quarter. Analysts are now forecasting that JD will post a loss for all of 2016 too. Only two months ago, Wall Street was predicting a profit.  So it looks like the endorsement from Walmart comes at a much needed time.  But it remains to be seen if the JD-Walmart alliance will be able to make a serious dent into Alibaba's market share. What's more, both Alibaba and Walmart continue to face an uphill battle against Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) -- which is now the world's most valuable retailer.

{"text": "It feels a bit blasphemous to turn the newest, coolest photo experience into one of the oldest, least dignified image formats. Unfortunately, not everyone can view Apple's (AAPL, Tech30) new Live Photos. But everyone can enjoy an animated GIF.  Live Photos are a delightful little mashup of videos and photos shot on the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. When you tap and hold on a still image, it springs to life as a three-second video.  They can only be viewed on Apple devices running iOS 9 or later, or on Macs running OS X El Capitan (launching September 30). A number of third parties are working to support Live Photos by the holidays, including Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Getty Images.  Until then, this workaround lets you share the video portion with people on PCs or Android devices, and on Twitter (TWTR, Tech30), Facebook, Tumblr or Instagram.  Free the video  Each Live Photo is actually a MOV and a JPG file bundled together with some secret Apple magic. If you share a Live Photo over email or text with someone who isn't on a compatible Apple device, they only receive the still image.  To extract the MOV file, plug your phone into a Mac and open Image Capture. It shows both files separately. Locate the MOV file you want and import it to your computer.  If you want to show it closer to how it appears on the iPhone 6S -- a still image that starts moving -- and don't care about audio, there's another option. Plug in your 6S to a Mac, open QuickTime Player and go to File --> New Movie Recording. Select your iPhone as the source, and hit record while you press and hold on a Live Photo.  Enjoy the movie  At this point, you have a usable movie file that can be viewed on most platforms or can be converted into other video formats. And unlike a GIF, it still includes audio. Tweet it, Facebook it, text it to your dad's Android smartphone. On average, the MOV files are around 3.5 MB, the same size as a still iPhone photo.  But if the allure of the animated GIF is too strong to resist ...  Pick a GIF maker  The Live Photo videos are around 14 frames per second, a great starting point for a GIF.  There are a number of tools and websites for turning movie files into GIFs. Photoshop gives you the most control, but not everyone has it. I really like the $4.99 GIFBrewery tool, available in the Apple App Store and for PCs. Import your MOV.  Minimize the size  The MOV files actually make for very large GIFs if you don't shrink them down. When created without any changes, my first GIFs were a whopping 12 MB.  Let's make them small enough to upload to the center of the GIF universe, Tumblr. Currently, a GIF must be under 2 MB and 500 pixels for Tumblr. Start by shrinking the file to 500 pixels. You can further shrink it down by trimming the length of the GIF or reducing the number of colors. Save and share.

{"text": "Billion dollar companies aren't immune to market turmoil. The tech world calls them unicorns -- privately held companies valued at $1 billion or more.  There are roughly 140 of these companies, and they're raising more and more money. Many are funded by nontraditional investors like hedge funds and mutual funds, with an emphasis on growing the company's customer base, rather than turning a profit.  But investors see returns when a company goes public -- and the outlook for tech initial public offerings is murky, at best. There have been just 15 tech IPOs this year, according to market research firm Renaissance Capital. That's the lowest, so far, since 2008. And tech IPOs -- including Etsy (ETSY) -- were among some of the worst performing in the second quarter of 2015.  Most agree that there will be some type of correction in the private market. Companies that have yet to make money, are spending far more than they're bringing in, and are focused on Silicon Valley's \"growth at all costs\" mentality may not weather an economic storm.  Venture capitalist Bill Gurley, an early investor in Uber, predicted that some unicorns would die this year.  E-commerce site Fab.com -- once valued at close to $1 billion -- suffered mass layoffs before it was acquired for an undisclosed amount in March. Evernote, valued as a unicorn in 2012, laid off 47 people and closed three of its global offices this week.  Upfront Ventures' Mark Suster warned this week that billion dollar valuations are hardly an emblem of status or safety.  \"Please know that this isn't the success by which to measure yourself,\" he wrote. After all, a valuation is based on predictions about a startup's potential. It doesn't mean a startup has $1 billion. It means people think it is worth $1 billion.  Once a unicorn doesn't mean always a unicorn  A recent report from research firm PitchBook points to some unicorns that might be in trouble in a market downturn.  Factors like when a company raised its last round -- and whether it is successfully generating revenue -- can be telling.  A unicorn like Genius -- one that PitchBook names -- hasn't announced any new funding in over a year. In July 2014, it brought in $40 million (and earned unicorn status).  Genius, which lets users annotate lyrics and historical texts online, could run into trouble unless it starts generating revenue. A spokesperson for the company declined to speak on the record.  Is the company past its IPO prime?  Some unicorns, like 14-year-old Bloom Energy and 8-year-old file hosting service Dropbox, have yet to go public. Will they ever?  According to Adley Bowden, senior director at PitchBook, a debt financing round -- like the $500 million one Dropbox raised in 2014 -- often signals that the company may soon IPO. Yet it hasn't.  It's not the first time analysts have been skeptical of Dropbox. A source close to the company said it has been profitable since its Series A in 2008. But it watched its competitor, Box (BOX), struggle in the public market after it IPOed in January. Dropbox has introduced standalone applications (like Carousel) that have had little traction. It also faces new competition in the shift away from file-sharing services to platforms like Slack.  \"They're not going to suddenly disappear,\" said Bowden, who added that companies like this may struggle to raise future rounds at the same or higher valuation.  Does the company have a plan if -- and when -- funding runs dry?  One unicorn, Nextdoor, raised a hefty round of $110 million in March, bringing its total funding to $200 million.  The company, a social networking platform for neighborhoods has -- not atypically -- focused on scale rather than generating revenue.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Nextdoor has grown tremendously since 2010 when it had just 170 neighborhoods on its platform. Now it has 75,000, out of an estimated 150,000 in the U.S, according to cofounder and CEO Nirav Tolia.  Tolia said that a fear of running out of cash is a non-issue for his business because there is an obvious, lucrative revenue stream he could turn on at any point. Over 60% of customers use Nextdoor to find local service providers, so targeted advertising is a natural fit.  Tolia said they raised money because of investor interest -- not because of need.  \"The best way to prepare is to have a significant war chest,\" said Tolia, noting that theirs could support an economic downturn that lasts for years. Gurley -- who is notorious for warning of a bubble -- was the company's first investor.  \"We agree that there will be some kind of rationalization in the market -- but it's not the companies that have $100 million in the bank,\" he said. \"It's the companies that are burning in excess of what they raised.\" ", "date": "October 2, 2015: 7:52 AM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/02/technology/pitchbook-unicorn-trouble/", "author": "Sara Ashley O'Brien"},

Now your headphones can either plug in to the same Lightning port you use to charge the iPhone, or connect via Bluetooth.

Until now, Apple customers could plug their headphones into any smartphone, tablet or computer without a second thought.  No longer.

But many watching the Apple launch event still expressed frustration -- some using the hashtag #courage.  \"Ready to not lose that dongle or pay $ for new one?

None of us came up with any excuse as hilarious as courage,\" one person tweeted.  \"CAN'T WAIT TO CHARGE MY EARPHONES EVERY NIGHT,\" tweeted another.    Some people were outraged even before the official announcement.  More than 300,000 people signed a petition at SumOfUs earlier this year urging Apple to keep the standard headphone jack. \"Not only will this force iPhone users to dole out additional cash to replace their hi-fi headphones, it will singlehandedly create mountains of electronic waste,\" according to the petition.

An impressive streak -- until he admits that most of the businesses failed.  \"But that's what entrepreneurship is about,\" he said. \"We do what others won't do so that later on we have the freedom to do what others can't do.\"  After 22 years of \"dabbling\" in his startup ideas -- everything from selling exercise equipment and office supplies to running an auto service station -- Jennings hit on his most successful one in 1995.  It was a residential locksmith service called Mr. Rekey, which he launched out of the trunk of his mom's car when he was 35. It took a decade for the business to reach its first million in sales. Today, the Austin-based firm generates annual revenue of almost $8 million, employs 100 people and is a national franchise.  Related Story: For entrepreneurs, cycling is the new golf  \"With Rekey, I finally figured it out,\" said Jennings. \"If I'm bootstrapping a startup, I have to be prepared to not give up too soon.\"  That's what he did with all of his other startups.  \"I'd hit a wall in six months and not know how to take the business to the next level,\" he said. \"I'd go get a job until the entrepreneurial itch struck again, and I'd fall back into the same cycle.\"  (Some of those other ventures included selling pizza, painting houses and installing smoke alarms.)  The pattern stopped with Mr. Rekey. Six months after starting the business, he still wasn't making money but he didn't bail on it. He hasn't looked back since.  Related: Halal butcher promises 'honest to God' burgers  Jennings says he loves the \"game of business.\"  \"I like taking educated risks and seeing something grow out of it,\" he said.  He got a taste of this after launching his first startup at 13. It was a door-to-door seed-selling venture that he pursued out of necessity.  \"My dad was an alcoholic who couldn't hold a job and drank up the family money,\" said Jennings. \"If I wanted toys and cool clothes, and later on a car, I realized that I had to make it happen for myself.\"  He made $400 in the first year and $1,500 the next year. \"I couldn't keep up with demand,\" he said.  But that early startup experience taught him basic fundamentals about entrepreneurship.  \"At 14, the important lesson I learned was that it's a lot about relationships,\" he said.  Related: Hot businesses to start now  Over the years, Jennings has crisscrossed the country to launch his ventures, which has come at a cost to his personal life.  He uprooted his son and daughter several times during their childhood (although both now work at Mr. Rekey's corporate headquarters). He also separated from his first wife and subsequently remarried.  \"Being a serial entrepreneur isn't for everybody. You have to have that itch in your blood,\" he said.  As he continues to grow Mr. Rekey, Jennings is also involved in five other startups that he helped launch, including a garage door installation service and a house flipping venture with his wife.  Still, life isn't all about business. Jennings works half days and took a month-long vacation to Costa Rica last year.  So what's on his mind lately? Jennings said he's starting to think about selling Mr. Rekey.  \"In a way, it would be nice to be free of it to start something else,\" he said.

{"text": "In a few years, we'll be able to strap on virtual reality goggles and plunge into a sprawling and complex virtual universe. But first, someone has to actually built it. Linden Lab wants to make it easier for people and companies to build their own virtual reality experiences.  The makers of the 13-year-old Second Life virtual world are designing a platform to create and host virtual reality experiences. Codenamed Project Sansar, Linden Lab's undertaking has been shrouded in secrecy. Last month, the company had a few Second Life veterans play around with the early beta. It was the first time anyone outside the company had set a (digital) foot in the world.  Think of it as the YouTube of the virtual world -- an entry point for anyone who wants to build a VR experience without investing a ton of time and money.  Second Life is an aging virtual world that had a lot of hype but never quite reached a mass audience. It peaked at a million users. It's still chugging along today with hundreds of thousands of loyal users. It's even profitable -- but it is not the future.  A year and a half ago, Linden Lab started plotting its entry into virtual reality.  Virtual and augmented reality will be a $150 billion market by 2020, according to Digi-Capital. Facebook's (FB, Tech30) Oculus Rift headset is leading the way with immersible video, audio and even touch experiences. A commercial version of the $1,500 device is expected to hit the market in early 2016, though it will take more time before any kind of VR tech spreads to the masses.  \"We know more than anybody else what it takes to do something like this,\" said Linden Lab CEO Ebbe Altberg.  Porting Second Life over to VR was quickly ruled out. The performance requirements for virtual reality are high -- it requires more frames per second and high resolution art. Starting fresh gave Linden Lab a chance to rethink how a virtual world is organized and how it makes money.  Creating worlds will be more difficult in Project Sansar than Second Life, but Altberg said they've made a tool non-engineers can use.  \"It's still extremely difficult to create content for virtual reality. Pretty much anything you want to create, you have to have a sophisticated engineering organization in place,\" said Altberg. \"We're trying to solve those problems.\"  A news publication could make a place to experience virtual versions of articles. Executives could gather in virtual meeting rooms. Doctors could open virtual health care clinics. They would all likely prefer to do it without having to build something complicated from the ground up.  Internally, Linden Labl employees are working on polishing the product, building their own test worlds along the way. They've made a desert scene with crazy big machinery, weird futuristic lounges and a famous landmark. They've even created an exact replica of a conference room in Linden Lab's San Francisco office, down to the objects on the desk.  Altberg expects to have the first version of Project Sansar available by the end of 2016. Then it will be up to creators and companies to decide what the coming virtual reality universe will look and feel like -- and what we'll actually do when we're there.

CNN produced a virtual reality version of the debate telecast, marking the first time that a news event was live-streamed to the Samsung GearVR headset.  There were four special VR cameras installed in the debate hall.  While wearing a headset, \"you are the cameraperson,\" said DJ Roller, the co-founder of Next VR, CNN's partner for the live-stream. \"You can look around wherever you are.\"  Two of the cameras were installed near the questioners, allowing VR viewers to see how the candidates reacted to each other. Another camera was right behind the candidates' podiums. And the fourth camera was embedded in the seating area.  \"You'd probably get attacked by the Secret Service if you tried to get as close as these cameras,\" Roller quipped before the debate.

Most people have never tried it before. But a successful debate live-stream had the potential to garner positive press and generate more momentum for the medium.  David Cole, the other co-founder of NextVR, estimated that 100,000 to 200,000 people own one of the necessary Samsung headsets and smart phones.  If you had the gear on Tuesday night, you could put it on and open up NextVR's application, where the debate stream was featured front and center.  At the debate site in Las Vegas, \"we've built a whole separate TV production inside the TV production,\" including a separate control room, Jason Farkas, the executive producer of CNNMoney, said Tuesday.  He compared the four VR cameras to \"four different seats in the audience\" for viewers to virtually sit in.  During the debate, Farkas tweeted that users in 73 countries were logged on the VR stream.  CNN tested VR cameras at its Republican presidential primary debate on September 16. It condensed the three-hour debate into a nine-minute highlight reel that can also be viewed through the Next VR app.  Mashable's Jason Abbruzzese, who reviewed it, said \"it is a completely unique experience.\"  He wished it were higher-resolution but said, \"You very much do get the sense of being there, with an ability to look at the audience, the moderators and even the other candidates as they react.\"  Several sporting events have been live-streamed in VR this year, including a soccer match back in July.

But the number of \"cost-burdened\" tenants -- those who spend more than 30% of their income on rent -- rose to 21.3 million people last year, according to Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies.  Of those, more than 26% are \"severely cost burdened\" and spend more than half of their income to cover rent.  Related: Cities with the largest rent increases  Here's the problem: rents are increasing much faster than wages. Inflation-adjusted rents increased 7% from 2001-2014 while household incomes dropped 9%, the report showed. At the same time, rising demand for rental units has pushed the national vacancy rate to a 30-year low, driving prices even higher.  \"These trends have led to record numbers of renters paying excessive amounts of income for housing, with little prospect for meaningful improvement,\" the report said. The median rent for a new apartment climbed to $1,372 last year, a 26% increase from 2012.  While low-income households are the most likely to have a hard time making ends meet, middle-income households are increasingly struggling to make rent.

Related: Here's how to set up a budget   Builders have ramped up construction recently, but supply hasn't kept up with demand and new units tend to focus on the higher end of the market.

Families that paid more than half of their income on rent spent 38% less on food last year and 55% less on health care, according to the report.

She calls her decision to rent a home instead of buying her smartest financial move.  In 2000, she found herself in a situation she never expected: going through divorce as the mother of two young daughters.  She and her ex-husband sold their Chicago home and Theresa faced a tough choice: Where would she go now? The homes she could afford were mostly in neighborhoods with mediocre schools.  Related: You probably can't afford to live near good schools  \"I did not spend all of the money I got from the sale of my home in the city on buying another home,\" Theresa told CNNMoney. \"I would have blown through the money fast.\"   For Theresa, the decision was simple: It was better to rent a shoebox in a good school district that would give her daughters the best chance at a better life than to own a home.  They moved to the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois and rented a small apartment she could afford on her income of $30,000 a year, working as a special education teaching assistant  She has heard that the people across the street from her paid over $500,000 to own their condominiums. In contrast, she pays $1,000 a month in rent. Her building is much older.  It's \"not a dream life,\" but it is near good schools and parks.  \"I truly believe in the American Dream -- living in your own four walls -- is only achievable with two high incomes,\" says Theresa, who also coaches and works as a camp director in the summers.  Related: What economic equality looks like in America  The statistics back up what Theresa has seen in her own life.  Homeownership in America peaked in 2004 when nearly 70% of adults owned their homes. Today that number has fallen to under 64%.  To put that another way, about 6 million families have transitioned from being homeowners to renters in the past decade.  \"There's not enough affordable housing and affordable rental housing in general right now,\" says Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow (Z).  One unexpected turn in life such a divorce or health scare can sometimes be enough to derail the homeownership dream.  The median income for an American family today is $53,657. Less than half of families that make under that amount a year own homes, according to the Census. In contrast, nearly 80% of families who earn above the median income own their homes.  \"I made my decision a long time ago to make sure my daughters got a great education,\" says Theresa, who is now 56.  Related: How we turned $500,000 into $1.3 million in a month  She has earned her master's degree in education and hopes to transition to a better teaching role.  Her younger daughter currently studies biology at Boston University on a scholarship. Theresa doubts that would have happened without the great teachers and resources of the school district her daughters attended.  \"The school district is one of the No. 1 drivers when people are looking to rent or buy a home,\" says Gudell of Zillow.  Theresa wishes more schools gave kids lessons in finance. She has worked since she was 14, but says \"I wish I would have known how expensive the rate of inflation is.\" She anticipates having to work until she's at least 70.  Her family rarely goes on vacation and Theresa still uses an old flip phone. Growing up as one of seven children, she learned to be thrifty with money.  Stagnant wages and inequality have become big issues on the 2016 campaign trail. Theresa has been too busy working and spending time with her grandchildren to pay much attention to the candidates yet.  \"But I would really look for a candidate who is going to start addressing the issues of the poor in our own communities,\" says Theresa.

It doesn't have the name recognition of Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB, Tech30) or Netflix (NFLX, Tech30). But it's important -- and not simply because of the numbers.  The company asked employees voluntary questions and pulled data from its HR systems to break down its stats on its racial and ethnic diversity, gender and LGBTQ employees.  It revealed that its workforce is 39% female and that 45% of its managers are women. But it still has a long way to go. 70% of its workforce is white, while just 4% is black and less than 1% is Hispanic/Latino.  \"In this process, we asked ourselves a simple question -- how can we do better?\" Slack founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield and VP of People & Policy Anne Toth wrote in a blog post. \"Our primary goal is to avoid becoming yet another place where underrepresented groups exit the technology industry,\"  Related: 15 Questions with Stewart Butterfield  Slack is one of the few tech startups to release numbers like this.  According to Joelle Emerson, founder of diversity consulting firm Paradigm, the company is \"uniquely early\" in its commitment to diversity given its age and size.  Slack raised $160 million at a $2.8 billion valuation earlier this year, making it a unicorn (the term for a firm valued at more than $1 billion).  Several other unicorn companies -- Airbnb, Dropbox and Pinterest -- have also released diversity reports. But with over 120 unicorns, the vast majority have yet to follow suit.  But Slack -- which helps teams collaborate -- has just 250 employees. It said it started reviewing its policies when it had just 75 employees.  Emerson has been working with Slack since March on efforts like unconscious bias training for its employees. This includes eliminating exercises known as \"whiteboarding,\" where companies screen engineering candidates by having them write code on a whiteboard. It's a practice that can weed out women, not due to competence but rather to intimidation.  Paradigm works with over a dozen other tech firms, including Pinterest, but Slack was one of its smallest clients when they first started working together.  \"The earlier a company is going to to work on this, the more successful they're going to be at it,\" said Emerson. \"As you grow, it gets exponentially harder ... [But] that doesn't mean its ever too late.\"  \"I hope that smaller unicorn companies will see what Slack has done,\" said Emerson, noting that it's not just about releasing numbers, it's also about being transparent about the steps they're taking to meaningfully boost diversity.  Slack listed four ways in which it is committed to building a more diverse workplace. These include examining all decisions in the hiring, compensation and management space; consulting with experts like Emerson on trainings and internal processes; supporting organizations that address pipeline issues like Hack the Hood; and working to be mentors and role models.  While companies have touted diversity as fundamental to innovation, Butterfield wants to see more diversity in the tech industry as a whole, not just at his company.  \"By far the best impact we could have would be a generation of ex-Slack people starting new companies, being role models, setting examples,\" said Butterfield in a tweet after the post went up.  When one Twitter user questioned why age and disability weren't included in Slack's diversity report, Butterfield tweeted back: \"Not (yet) measured. However, not ignored :)\" ", "date": "September 11, 2015: 3:29 PM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/11/technology/slack-diversity-report/index.html", "author": "Sara Ashley O'Brien"},
{"text": "Despite rumors to the contrary, the iPhone 6S is not waterproof. CNNMoney put the new iPhone's water resistance to the test, dunking it in a vase of water for five minutes.  Remarkably, the iPhone 6S continued to operate while submerged. But within seconds of taking a dip in the water, air bubbles began streaming up from the iPhone, suggesting that water was collecting inside the device. A minute into the test, water began distorting the bottom of the screen.  The iPhone continued to function for about 10 minutes after taking it out of the water, with a few hiccups. The phone did not play any music, because it thought that headphones were plugged into the jack -- possibly because the headphone port was waterlogged. Eventually, the screen went completely white, stopped functioning, and then shut off for good.  Still, lasting that long in water is an impressive feat for a smartphone. Gadget insurance company Protect Your Bubble recently put the iPhone 5 to a similar test, and the smartphone stopped working after 10 seconds in an aquarium.  Protect Your Bubble also dunked the iPhone 6S in an aquarium, and the phone continued to operate for 45 minutes under water. The insurance company believes that the iPhone 6S tests might have produced different results because of the positioning of the iPhone: The phone was lying flat in the aquarium, but upright in CNNMoney's vase.  Apple (AAPL, Tech30) never actually made a claim that the iPhone 6S was waterproof.  Ahead of the iPhone 6S launch in September, some tech blogs reported rumors that the new iPhone would be water resistant. The rumors were given some validity when Apple earlier this year was granted a patent to make electronic \"components within a computing device\" water resistant.  An iFixit teardown of the iPhone 6S seemed to confirm that the iPhone 6S was built with water resistance. Rubber washers were placed around all of the iPhone's ports, helping to prevent water from seeping in.  That likely could help the iPhone 6S survive a quick, accidental dunk into the toilet. But if your phone makes it into the ocean, you can probably kiss it goodbye.  CNNMoney also tested the new iPhone for scratch resistance and shatter resistance. The iPhone 6S held up pretty well in both tests.  The screen survived an onslaught of key scratches and jabs. It also survived three four-foot drops onto a concrete staircase -- with some notable dings and dents.  Earlier this month, Motorola unveiled the Droid Turbo 2, with the world's first shatterproof smartphone screen.  With water resistance, scratch resistance and shatterproof technology, our smartphones are becoming far more klutz-proof than in previous years.

From startup burn rates, to skyhigh valuations, to hefty rounds of funding, here's what investors are saying about the future of startups.  Prominent venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said he's certain the market will turn. When it does, this will be a problem for tech firms with high \"burn rates\" -- a means of measuring how fast a company spends capital.  \"When the market turns, and it will turn, we will find out who has been swimming without trunks on,\" Andreessen said in an 18-tweet rant in September.  Andreessen minced no words when he told startups to \"worry,\" warning that the firms that do survive will be \"few and far between.\"  But he's still singing the praises of VC funding for entrepreneurs who are pursuing an outcome they can't reach on their own.  \"VC is very much not for every company. But for companies that want to do something big, VC = the most aligned capital there is,\" he tweeted.  Bill Gurley, venture capitalist at Benchmark Capital said we're in a \"risk bubble.\"  Companies are netting millions but they are far from mature.  \"Constraints and profitability help you make decisions better,\" Gurley told author Malcolm Gladwell during a keynote at SXSW. \"Being able to do everything leads to poor business execution. Burn rates are higher than they've ever been. In Silicon Valley, you have more people employed by money-losing companies probably than you've ever had before.\"  Gurley -- whose firm invests in tech firms like Uber -- said Silicon Valley knows no fear, which isn't necessarily a good thing.  \"I do think you'll see some dead unicorns this year,\" he said, referring to startups valued at over $1 billion.  Billionaire investor Mark Cuban thinks we're worse off today than in 2000.  \"In the tech bubble, it was Broadcast.com, AOL, Netscape, etc. Today it's Uber, Twitter, Facebook, etc.,\" he wrote on his blog.  During the last bubble, investors were betting on public companies -- today, they're putting money into private enterprises. This is a dangerous proposition, according to Cuban, because there's no liquidity for these investments.  \"I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that most of these individual angels and crowdfunders are currently underwater in their investments,\" he said. \"The only thing worse than a market with collapsing valuations is a market with no valuations and no liquidity.\"  Altman spoke out on the topic in an attempt to silence the bubble talk once and for all.  \"I'm tired of reading about investors and journalists claiming there's a bubble in tech,\" wrote Altman in a blog post this week.  Altman acknowledges that there have been some unreasonable early-stage valuations, but those are insignificant compared to the larger market.  He made several predictions about the next five years that would disprove the \"bubble\" theories. This included that six \"unicorns\" -- Uber, Palantir, Airbnb, Dropbox, Pinterest and SpaceX -- will be collectively worth over $200 billion by January 1, 2020. That's double what they're worth today, according to Altman.  He challenged a venture capitalist to disagree. Whoever is wrong owes $100,000 to charity.  That didn't quiet talk of a bubble, though.  Michael Arrington, founder of TechCrunch and general partner at CrunchFund, tweeted in response. \"I'm not overly worried about a bubble, but VCs tossing around $100K personal wagers tells me something is off.\" ", "date": "May 5, 2015: 5:03 PM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/25/technology/bubble-talk-roundup/", "author": "Sara Ashley O'Brien"},
{"text": "Apple has been granted a patent for new EarPod headphones, which could hint at what's going to ship with the new iPhone 7. The new patent, granted on Tuesday, is for headphones that connect to an iPhone both wirelessly and with a wire. They can be used without being plugged in, but have a connector that lets you magnetically attach a cord to the earbuds and plug the other end into a jack.  The EarPod design follows rumors that the iPhone 7 could ship without a headphone jack. Many people assumed that Apple would design new EarPods that would wirelessly connect to iPhones using Bluetooth. Some believe they will connect to the iPhone's Lightning port.  But headphone jacks aren't going away everywhere. Not every music-playing device has Bluetooth.  So Apple has patented a unique concept: hybrid, detachable headphones. They're wireless when you want them to be and they have a wire when you need one.  Apple's patent likely isn't exactly what will ship with the iPhone 7. The patent shows a set of headphones that require a cord to be plugged into a headphone jack -- that cord can be separated from the earbuds and wirelessly transmit the signal to the detached headphones.  But the patent was initially filed in March 2011, and technology has evolved since then. Headphones that connect wirelessly but can also be plugged in would represent a pretty neat innovation.  Related: 5 ways to expand your iPhone's storage beyond 16 GB  Apple last updated its EarPods in 2012, so they're due for an upgrade.  Rumors started swirling in November about Apple dropping the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, and several Apple suppliers have reportedly lent credence to that notion.  The current iPhone 6S is 7.1 mm thick. So if Apple wants to slim down the iPhone 7, it's has to contend with the 3.5 mm jack. It's running out of real estate.

{"text": "Sports photographer Al Bello has shot 11 Olympics Games, but this summer is his first capturing live-action pictures with the help of underwater robots. The 23-year Getty Images veteran is using underwater robotic cameras at the Rio Olympic Games during a series of aquatic events, including swimming, diving and synchronized diving. The robots help Bello get far more versatile photos of swimmers taken from the bottom of the pool -- the shots you later see in news articles and broadcasts.  Although this isn't the first year underwater robotic cameras will be used at the Olympics -- Getty competitor Reuters used similar robots during the 2012 London Olympic Games -- the method is catching on.  Related: Apple's Olympics ad honors diversity with help from Maya Angelou  \"In the past, with a traditional submerged static remote camera, you'd have to visualize the photos you wanted ahead of time and think about what race and stroke you want to capture,\" Bello said. \"It was limiting; you could only guess where the swimmer was going to be when they came into the frame.\"  If the camera's placement was slightly miscalculated and a swimmer's fingertips were cut off in images, photographers were unable to fix the issue until after the swim session wrapped. Photographers, who use a remote control trigger to take the pictures, are not allowed in the water during competition.  With two sessions each day that last for several hours apiece, the stakes are high to secure solid photos, especially when eight to 10 other photo agencies are gunning for similar underwater shots. Each organization is allowed only one camera in the pool at a time.  Now, Getty's underwater robots give photographers the flexibility to make changes in real time.  \"A robotic camera lets you zoom in, tilt, spin or get multiple angles,\" Bello said. \"I can now execute many ideas in one session; before, I had the chance to make one happen. I'm doing a lot more photos now in a lot less time.\"  The robots don't move along the bottom of the pool, but its housing pod allows the camera -- a Canon (CAJ) 1DX Mark II -- to adjust slightly.  During a competition, Bello stands near the finish line in front of a live computer screen, with a video game controller to access the camera from afar. He uses the robot's features and the remote trigger, coupled with his best judgment, to capture a swimmer as he or she comes into the frame.  Related: Smart robots could soon steal your job  Bello and his team -- which includes two other Getty photographers, Clive Rose and Adam Pretty -- will be using the same method when they rotate sessions and equipment throughout the Olympics. The agency, which declined to comment on the robot's pricing, brought two to Rio.  Robotic cameras will appear in many forms throughout the games this summer, largely overhead at the major venues. Photographers and technicians have been working since early July to install them across the city.  But for Bello and the team, all of whom are SCUBA certified, the photographers check on the underwater robots and troubleshoot at the bottom of the pool each day. Meanwhile, the cables that power the equipment, which run about 200 feet across the length of the pool and up onto the deck, are also routinely monitored.  Even though robots have an increased presence at the Olympics, Bello believes the cameras won't be replacing the need for human photographers anytime soon.  \"The robots are just another tool for me to get better photos,\" Bello said. \"A robot doesn't think on its own or come up with ideas. But it can help us get photos more efficiently than ever before.\"  Getty recently opened up a free part of its image collection to consumers with the launch of an Olympics-focused photo site. Traditionally, Getty Images are often downloaded (and purchased) by businesses, mostly media outlets. But the platform highlights about 5,000 Olympics photos each day, including some taken by Bello and the team, into one place that's easily shareable on social media.

{"text": "In one industrial-redesign swoop, Apple just rendered millions of iGizmo accessories useless for those who upgrade to its latest devices. The good news: There's a fix. The bad news: It'll cost you $30 a pop.  The wave of new gadgets Apple (AAPL) unveiled Wednesday -- the iPhone 5 and an overhauled iPod nano and touch -- are the first to use a new eight-prong \"lightning\" connector. It's much tinier than the 30-pin connector that has been Apple's standard since 2003.  \"It's time for the connector to evolve,\" Apple executive Phil Schiller announced at Apple's unveiling event.  The new lightning connector is 80% smaller than Apple's old one, a feat that helped Apple make the iPhone 5 the thinnest smartphone on the market. It also means that all the zillions of power cords Apple fans have stashed to keep their gadgets charged are now obsolete.  The iPhone 5 will come with its own lightning cord, but Apple devotees rarely use just one. More problematically, anyone who wants to connect their brand-new iPhone with an older accessory like a speaker system or charging dock will be faced with mismatched connections.  Schiller quickly noted in his talk that Apple would be releasing an adapter to bridge the transition pain. He didn't comment about its price tag, but Apple's online store already has the adapters available for pre-order. Brace yourself: They cost $29 each, or $39 if you want one with a cord attached. A lightning-to-USB cable goes for a comparatively cheap $19.  Apple has a history of charging eye-popping prices for its accessories. An official Apple USB power plug currently goes for $29, plus another $19 if you want a cord to go with it. Lost the earphones (now called \"EarPods\") that came with your iPod? It'll be $29 for a replacement.  The frugal-minded can save by buying third-party accessories. The same plug-and-cord combo that costs nearly $50 from Apple can be bought for mere pennies on eBay (EBAY) from manufacturers in China. Knock-off versions of Apple's lightning adapters haven't hit the shops yet, but it's a safe bet they'll be available by the time Apple starts shipping its own adapters.  Apple's favored device makers got an advance warning about the connector redesign. \"We've been aware this was coming,\" says Christopher Allen, CEO of gadget maker iDevices in Avon, Conn.  IDevices will skate through relatively unscathed. It was an early adopter of the latest iTrend: doing away with the connectors completely. Its current products -- including the iGrill thermometer and waterproof iShower speaker -- use Bluetooth to link up with iPods, iPhones and other Apple gadgets. Many other devices have made the same shift.  \"It decouples the devices from having to be connected to anything other than to charge,\" Allen says. The latest version of Bluetooth makes device detection and set-up almost invisible: \"It really makes for a magical experience.\"  The Bluetooth wave means many gadgets will be insulated from Apple's shift, but for those who need Apple's connectors to link their old accessories and charging cords, the upgrade will be pricey magic.  One tech blogger called the \"beyond ridiculous\" price tag \"a slap in the face.\" On Twitter, a commentator channeled his range into an all-caps blast: \"TESTING MY PATIENCE NOW MR APPLE.\" ", "date": "September 13, 2012: 12:51 PM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/12/technology/apple-lightning-adapter-price-tag/", "author": "Stacy Cowley"},
{"text": "Turns out, contract workers might not be the answer to the on-demand economy. On Monday, grocery delivery startup Instacart announced a new option for some of its contract workers: become an employee.  This comes after last week's ruling that one San Francisco Uber driver is, in fact, an employee. The finding is shining a spotlight on Uber and hoards of other startups that rely on contract workers.  Since launching in 2012, Instacart has used contractors to pick up and deliver groceries to customers.  But starting Monday, some of Instacart's Chicago workers can choose to be part-time employees. This just applies to the \"personal shoppers\" who pick out items for customers; its drivers will remain contract workers for now.  Instacart's decision to explore an employee model came before the Uber finding. The startup -- which has raised $275 million in venture capital and is valued at $2 billion -- has been experimenting with part-time employees in a Boston pilot since February.  \"The data showed that this change improved the quality and efficiency of order picking and made for a better customer experience,\" said Instacart founder and CEO Apoorva Mehta in a press release.  It's something that cleaning startup Managed by Q realized from the beginning: In order to deliver quality service, it needed to be the best employer. And that meant hiring workers and offering benefits, sick leave and flexible work hours.  \"The general rule of thumb I've heard -- which resonates with our experience -- is that employees are 25%-30% more expensive than independent contractors,\" said Dan Teran, co-founder of Managed by Q. That varies depending on things like benefits and employee training.  For Instacart, the biggest upfront costs will be worker's comp and payroll expenses, according to Instacart spokeswoman Andrea Saul.  \"[But] we think it'll be worth it to deliver better service,\" said Saul, who notes that they're now able to perform management trainings and provide more quality control.  The wages Instacart pays its employees vary by market -- Saul said they pay more than local minimum wages, said Saul. As employees, they'll be eligible for unemployment, social security and Medicare.  Most Instacart \"shoppers\" work between 24 and 30 per week. With the new policy, part-time workers won't be able to work more than 30 hours a week, as that tips them into the full-time bucket, which mandates healthcare coverage.  Instacart anticipates that 75% of its shoppers will opt for part-time employee status (based on the pilot findings.)  Shannon Liss-Riordan, a labor lawyer who is representing Uber drivers in a separate case, said she was \"very happy\" to hear of Instacart's move.  \"Instacart is one of the major players in the area. I hope more companies come to this realization and that this is part of a trend we may be seeing,\" she said.  Instacart, which now operates in 16 cities and has 7,000 contract workers, plans to roll out the option to other cities in the coming months.

And now, Softbank says it wants to cash in some of its 32% stake to boost its own financial position. Softbank's latest annual profits fell 29%, taking a hit from its investment in struggling U.S. wireless carrier Sprint (S).

{"text": "The first live-VR broadcast of a major soccer tournament took place on Saturday. Manchester United played FC Barcelona in the International Champions Cup match. Tens of thousands of people cheered the teams on at Levi's stadium in Santa Clara, California, where it was sunny and 75.  My friends and I watched through a pair of Samsung Gear VR headsets in a humid New York City apartment.  For two hours, the three of us took turns adjusting the straps around our ears and our hair, simultaneously excited and annoyed by the whole thing.  It was a more interesting way to watch soccer for a sometimes-fan like me, but an isolating experience for my football-loving friends who enjoy watching sports in groups.  The event  The game was live-streamed in high-frame rate (60 frames per second) from five Red Digital 6K cameras. Both Gear VR headsets were paired with a Samsung Galaxy Note 4.  Next VR, the software company responsible for compressing and transmitting the video feeds on Saturday, has tested many other sporting events in the past, including NBA and NHL games, NASCAR races, and the U.S. Open.  The good  The live stream was only lightly produced, making me almost feel as if I were at the event. There was no sweeping sports music, dramatic athlete animations or interviews, or ads. There were replays and magnified views of the field during key moments.  From my view \"in the stands,\" people took selfies at their seats and struggled with their drinks and food on the stairs. The knowledge that I was actually strapped into a machine was a little too easy to forget after a few minutes.  The bad  There were numerous issues with the video and audio streams during the game. Sometimes the audio would cut out, and sometimes the screen would go dark. Many times the entire thing froze because the phones got too hot.  The problem? Next VR told me it was my Wi-Fi connection struggling to process the incredible amount of data necessary to stream to two headsets at the same time. But even after I turned off one of the headsets, the choppy feeds continued.  My situation was an \"outlier\" among the \"roughly 100 folks watching remotely,\" the company told me.  Having to turn off the phones and wait until they cooled down, I probably watched less than half an hour of the approximately two-hour broadcast in total.  The picture quality also could have been better. It wasn't high definition, and the views weren't 360-degrees. Both features are coming in the future.  The verdict  Streaming a VR-feed of a live sports game is challenging, and -- when I could get the video to play -- this was a good start. But before companies can expect to charge for something like this, producers will have to make sure the video and audio streams are seamless.  And though it was nice being in two places at once, it would've been better if it felt like my friends were with me in VR -- especially since they were sitting next to me in real life, watching the same thing.  Oh, and if someone can figure out how to make the whole thing a little less sweaty, eye-straining, and a bit nauseating after the headset comes off, that'd be great too. (Next VR says my prayers will be answered in the next generation of devices, and that again, my situation with vertigo is something they \"very seldom hear.\")  Otherwise, it was a fun test and great way to watch the game without the overpriced snacks, stadium traffic, and getting sunburned.

{"text": "Zac Rankin is very thankful he suffered from insomnia earlier this year. On nights he couldn't sleep, he started reading about the stock market.  \"I was Googling stuff all day long. I would spend hours just reading about how stocks behave,\" the 21-year old told CNNMoney.  Rankin is a senior at Southeast Missouri State University. He's captain of the team that just won the top prize in the TD Ameritrade (AMTD) thinkorswim challenge, a stock market competition for college students.  They beat out over 475 other teams, including those from business schools and Ivy Leagues.  The contest was simple: Each team was allotted $500,000 of fake money. Whoever had the most at the end of a month won.  Rankin and his teammates ended the competition with $1.3 million -- a gain of 162%.  More risk, more possible return  \"We had nothing to lose. If we end up losing all $500,000, oh well,\" admits Rankin. \"We basically just decided to be as risky as possible.\"  The team was in last place after the initial week of trading. They realized they couldn't treat this like a retirement account with safe investments and a long-term focus.  They pivoted quickly to options trading, where you place bets that stocks will rise or fall.  \"This was my first experience trading options,\" says Rankin, who watched every single online course offered by the Options Industry Council.  The winning trades  Many of the team's bets lost money, but there were two huge wins.  1. Betting the Nasdaq 100 would rise -- On October 19, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) index closed at 108.74. The team bet it would rise above 111. They purchased 9,000 \"call\" options for a mere 3 cents each. They sold them on Oct. 23 for $1.42 each. By then, the Nasdaq 100 had risen to nearly 113.  Total gain: $1,251,000  2. Betting that Qualcomm stock would tumble -- On November 2, Qualcomm (QCOM, Tech30) stock closed at $60.64 a share. The team knew that earnings were coming up soon and the stock could fall a lot if the report was bad. So they bought 2,000 \"put\" options betting the stock would fall below $56. They paid a mere 35 cents an option. By November 5, the stock was trading at only $51.07. The team was able to sell the options for $5.45 apiece.  Total gain: $1,020,000  The other key to their success was diverse perspectives. No one on the team is a finance major.  Rankin comes closest with a business administration focus. Ben Asselmeier specializes in computer science and graphics, John Racanell is a psychology major and Chelsey Winsor is an accounting major.  They all researched ideas and Rankin had the final say.  \"Any student can participate [in the contest], regardless of major,\" says Nicole Sherrod, managing director of TD Ameritrade. She was an English major herself before taking an intro to investing course in college.  How to learn about investing  Rankin admits that coming up with winning investing ideas isn't easy. Even after winning the competition, he calls himself a \"beginner.\"  \"Investing is almost like getting a big school assignment. You have to keep studying and keep learning,\" says Rankin.  Many Millennials find investing confusing, but Rankin believes others can follow his lead. He learned almost entirely by reading articles and watching videos online until he took an investment course at school this semester.  Once he got passionate about it, he started trading ideas with his grandfather and with other enthusiasts in online forums like InvestorsHub.  Rankin's personal portfolio is still in the red from some of the stock he bought earlier this year. But he's more focused on the long-term. And that $3,500 he just won in the contest? He plans to invest it.

People are suffering, and because of his position at Apple (AAPL, Tech30), he's able to do something about it.  \"It became so clear to me kids were being bullied in school, kids were getting discriminated against, kids were even being disowned by their own parents,\" he said. \"I needed to do something.\"  Cook said he asks himself the same question everyday, one originally posed by Martin Luther King, Jr.: \"What are you doing for others?\"  That's why Cook -- a staunch advocate for personal privacy -- has gone public.  \"I valued my privacy significantly, [but] I felt that I was valuing it too far above what I could do for other people,\" he said. \"I wanted to tell everyone my truth.\"  One audience member, Molly Evans, said she appreciated Cook's openness during the interview.  \"It's inspiring that he gave up his own privacy to help others,\" Evans said.  Another audience member, Sarah Drake, said: \"I thought he was lovely. You have to be a brilliant man to be head of a company like that.\"  Both women clutched their iPhone 6 devices as they spoke.  Colbert also asked Cook to comment on rumors about a future Apple car, and the possibility the company will create original content for Apple TV. Cook responded with jokes, but wouldn't confirm any plans.  Cook also showed a distaste for upcoming Steve Jobs biopics that show the late company co-founder in an unflattering light: as a brutal, unforgiving and sometimes exploitative executive.  Cook pushed back on those portrayals: \"He was a joy to work with. I think that a lot of people are trying to be opportunistic, and I hate this. It's not a great part of our world.\"  The Apple boss is the third tech luminary to come on Colbert's show since its debut last Tuesday. Last Wednesday, Colbert hosted Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk. On Thursday, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick made an appearance.  During the question and answer portion of Tuesday's taping, which is not typically aired, Colbert was asked which big name in tech he'd like to have on next.  \"Thomas Edison!\" Colbert joked.  An audience member mentioned Facebook (FB, Tech30) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Colbert said that would be great.  He then jokingly added that he could always bring on Jesse Eisenberg, who starred as Zuckerberg in the Facebook biopic \"The Social Network\" and \"no one would know\" the difference.

{"text": "Welcome to the billion device club, Apple. Apple announced the sale of its billionth iPhone on Wednesday, nine years after the smartphone first went on sale.  \"We never set out to make the most, but we've always set out to make the best products that make a difference,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said at an employee meeting on Wednesday, according to a statement. \"Thank you to everyone at Apple for helping change the world every day.\"  The milestone is a reminder of the nearly unprecedented reach and success of the iPhone.  The iPhone catapulted Apple (AAPL, Tech30) to become the most valuable business in the world and continues to account for the majority of Apple's revenue.  But the announcement comes one day after Apple reminded the world that the iPhone magic is fading.  Related: Apple sales fall for second straight quarter  Apple sold 40.4 million iPhones in the quarter ending in June, down from 48 million a year earlier, according to its latest earnings report. That marks the second straight quarter of sales declines.  Customers are taking longer to upgrade their phones. Many analysts have raised concerns that the global smartphone market is saturated. And overall sales in China, touted as Apple's next big market, fell by a third from the previous year.  Cook admitted on a conference call with analysts that Apple was caught off guard by the slower rate of customers upgrading to the iPhone 6S, which was released last fall. \"Maybe that was a predictable thing, although we didn't predict it in the beginning,\" he said. \"It took us a little time to realize that.\"  All eyes are now on the next iPhone launch this fall to reinvigorate sales.  Apple will reportedly break with its usual strategy of overhauling the iPhone every two years. The next generation iPhone is expected to ditch the headphone jack, but otherwise only receive small tweaks compared to the models on the market.  If Apple can't keep growing the market for the iPhone, it will need to find another product with the potential to hit the billion mark.

{"text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook came out Thursday, acknowledging publicly for the first time that he is gay. \"Let me be clear: I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me,\" he wrote in a column in Bloomberg Businessweek.  In his column, the Apple (AAPL, Tech30) chief said that he had tried to maintain \"a basic level of privacy.\" But he said he decided that desire for privacy was stopping him from working for the benefit of others.  \"I don't consider myself an activist, but I realize how much I've benefited from the sacrifice of others,\" he said. \"So if hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone, or inspire people to insist on their equality, then it's worth the trade-off with my own privacy.\"  Related: Tim Cook isn't the only openly gay CEO  Cook, who grew up in Alabama, said he has long been open about his sexual orientation, but had just not previously discussed it publicly.  \"Plenty of colleagues at Apple know I'm gay, and it doesn't seem to make a difference in the way they treat me,\" he wrote. \"Of course, I've had the good fortune to work at a company that loves creativity and innovation and knows it can only flourish when you embrace people's differences. Not everyone is so lucky.\"  There have been some rumors and speculation that Cook is gay. Out magazine had previously named him as the most powerful gay person on its Power 50 list.  But there are no other publicly gay CEO's at the 700 largest corporations. John Browne served as CEO of BP (BP) from 1995 to 2007, and acknowledged he was gay after he was forced to leave office. He resigned when an former boyfriend outed him. He has since written a book \"The Glass Closet: Why Coming Out is Good Business.\"  Browne expressed his support for Cook on Thursday, saying, \"By deciding to speak publicly about his sexuality, Tim Cook has become a role model, and will speed up changes in the corporate world. This is an important step in the journey towards full and uncompromising inclusion of LGBT people.\"  A year ago, Cook announced support for a federal law which would have protected workers from facing discrimination based on their sexual orientation.  \"For too long, too many people have had to hide that part of their identity in the workplace,\" he wrote at the time.  And in December at an event organized by his alma mater Auburn University, he spoke of dealing with discrimination in his life.  \"I have seen and have experienced many types of discrimination, and all of them were rooted in the fear of people that were different than the majority,\" he said in that speech.

{"text": "I moved to New York City almost exactly two years ago. People often ask me what the biggest difference is about living in the Big Apple versus the small Pennsylvania city where I lived before. Here's the one that stands out the most: Inequality.  New York has one of the biggest gaps between the rich and the poor in America.  The wealth split is evident everywhere in New York -- from the type of transportation people take to work (private car versus subway or bus) to the cross streets where people live (Park Avenue versus the Bronx).  And that's to say nothing of the fact that a lot of people in Manhattan can pinpoint your income just by looking at your handbag and shoes.  Money is a constant conversation in New York City, from how much you tip to what you pay in rent.  Related: America's 10 most unequal cities   I used to live in central Pennsylvania. It's mere hours from New York City by car or train, but it often feels like another country, and not because of the Amish.  Central Pennsylvania is home to Lancaster and York, two of the most equal cities in America. They are places where that gap between the have and have-nots is at its smallest.  While salaries are lower where I was before (the median household income in the New York City area is $66,000 compared to around $57,000 in Lancaster and York), it's easier to make your money go further.  \"When friends and family come to visit, they're blown away at the prices of things, especially beer or a glass of wine,\" says Jennifer Brillhart, who moved to York, Pennsylvania with her husband after living in Manhattan and Philadelphia.  Costs add up: Housing costs roughly 360% more in Manhattan than York, Pennsylvania and groceries are over 40% more expensive in the Big Apple. To put that another way, a person making $50,000 in York would need to make over $100,000 to have a similar lifestyle in New York City, according to CNNMoney's Cost of Living calculator.  Brillhart can get a sandwich, bag of chips and soda for $4 at York's popular Central Market. She and her husband moved to York because they easily found jobs in law and non-profit management, but they stayed because of the quality of life.  It's much easier to afford a home and day-to-day necessities, and there's less traffic.  Not just a boring town: Jami Rhynes grew up near Lancaster and couldn't wait to leave sleepy farm country behind, but after living in Michigan and Japan for a few years, she found her hometown transformed.  Rhynes is the Chief Deputy Register of Wills and rattles off numerous restaurants and specialty coffee shops she loves in downtown Lancaster. When I ask if her friends talk about rent and budgets, she laughs and says that would be a strange conversation.  \"I always thought I would live in New York City. Now I can't even imagine it,\" says Rhynes, 34. \"We have such a close knit and intertwined city.\"  Eric Kazda had a similar experience. He never envisioned living in Lancaster, but he's glad he ended up there. He started an internet marketing business in 2008 that has expanded regionally, and he was able to buy a nice house for under $200,000.  \"There are lots of emerging businesses [in Lancaster]. The night scene has grown with lots of bars and restaurants over the past 5 or 6 years. It's a really interesting place to be,\" Kazda, 34, says.  He's only a few hours from clients and entertainment in Washington D.C., Philadelphia and New York, but his daily lifestyle is much less stressful.  Related: Wealth gap between middle class and rich widest ever  Big versus small cities: It's perhaps not surprising that many of America's cities with the biggest inequality problems are places like New York, Miami and Los Angeles. They attract billionaires, but also immigrants and those who fall out of the mainstream, willingly or not.  In contrast, many of America's most equal communities are smaller cities -- places like Anchorage, Alaska, Salem, Oregon, and York, Pennsylvania -- that have several hundred thousand residents. They may not have the culture that the global metropolises do, but many have a large and thriving middle class.  Of course, no place is perfect. Rhynes notes that in recent months Lancaster has developed a problem with panhandling.  And both Lancaster and York have had struggles with racism as the Latino population increases. But residents in these cities are quick to point out the many collaborations going on between groups like the Lancaster Young Professionals and the First Thursday Latino network.  The bottom line is it's easier to \"make it\" in a place where most people earn close to the median income and are able to afford a house and a night out from time to time.  As the debate about inequality in America intensifies in the 2016 election cycle, it's important to remember that there are places that are thriving without leaving so many people behind.  You can even get your specialty coffee or gluten-free baked goods in these cities, it just costs a heck of a lot less.

Neighborhoods with the best schools also tend to be the most expensive.  The country's least affordable? Atherton, California, 94027, which is located in San Mateo County.  To live near the highly rated Encinal Elementary School there, parents would be faced with a median home price just north of $6 million, which translates to monthly payments near $37,000, according to housing data provider RealtyTrac. That's a mere 412% more than the average monthly wage of $8,953 for the area.  RealtyTrac scanned more than 1,800 zip codes nationwide that have at least one \"good\" elementary school. \"Good\" is defined as schools that post higher-than-average test scores for their given state. Then RealtyTrac compared median home prices in those zip codes with the average wage for the area.  Related: The most expensive housing market is...

{"text": "Can Pinterest hack tech's diversity problem? It's certainly trying to. The company has already been lauded for its commitment to diversity, but now it's getting even more proactive.  On Thursday, Pinterest, which has over 600 employees, announced its 2016 diversity goals. The company -- which has received $1.3 billion in funding and is valued at $11 billion -- hopes that by sharing this information publicly, it'll make its progress easier to benchmark.  In 2013, Pinterest engineer Tracy Chou called on tech companies to reveal their diversity numbers in a much-buzzed-about Medium post.  Her effort pre-dates the more formal reports that some big firms have since started publishing. In 2014, Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30) released formal diversity reports about the internal makeup of their workforces. As second annual reports roll out, the numbers show that white men still dominate.  Even Pinterest has only seen \"modest progress over the past year,\" according to a blog post by co-founder Evan Sharp.  The company's updated diversity stats show that while women make up 42% of its workforce, employees are still predominately white (49%) and Asian (43%). Its tech, engineering, leadership teams are largely made up of men. One exception is non-tech jobs, where women account for 66% of employees.  \"We think one reason it's been so hard to get numbers to change is that companies haven't stated specific goals,\" wrote Sharp.  That inspired Sharp to share Pinterest's goals and the company's plans for achieving them.  Pinterest wants 30% of its new engineering hires to be women and 8% to be from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds. It also wants 12% of new hires for non-engineering roles to be from underrepresented backgrounds. Pinterest will require managers to interview at least one woman and one person from an underrepresented background when hiring for leadership positions.  To get there, Sharp said the company plans to recruit from a wider variety of universities and launch an \"early identification intern program\" for freshman and sophomore students that come from underrepresented backgrounds. It will require employees to participate in unconscious bias training, and will support a training and mentorship program for black software engineers and students.  It has also launched a formalized effort with diversity research and consulting firm Paradigm called Inclusion Labs.  Paradigm, headed by Joelle Emerson, has been working with Pinterest for seven months on unconscious bias training, data collection, diversity recruitment and company culture. Inclusion Labs will be the continuation of these efforts -- with the hopes of using Pinterest as a test bed to understand what's working and what's not and share that with others.  \"We're interested in designing and testing ideas that have potential to impact the tech industry at large,\" wrote Emerson in a Medium post on Thursday. \"Pinterest shares our passion for impact, and has expressed to us their belief that by cultivating a more diverse and inclusive tech community, every company within that community will be better off.\" ", "date": "July 30, 2015: 6:36 PM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/30/technology/pinterest-diversity-2016-goals/", "author": "Sara Ashley O'Brien"},
{"text": "What happens when a flashy luxury carmaker decides to open a massive factory in a desert town? Home sales and prices get a boost.  Tesla (TSLA) started construction on the lithium ion battery producing Gigafactory outside Sparks, Nevada, in June 2014. But talk about a factory had been swirling before that.  From the time the rumors began, the median home price in Sparks have shot up nearly 42%, according to ATTOM Data Solutions. During that same time period, home prices nationwide rose 31%.  CEO Elon Musk referenced plans for a Gigafactory in a November 2013 Tesla earnings call.  \"We're talking about something that's comparable to all lithium ion production in the world in one factory. Big,\" he said in response to an analyst's question, according to a transcript of the call.  While he wasn't specific with location details, speculation mounted.  In February 2014, Telsa shared a blog post that showed Nevada as one of four possible locations.  When complete, the factory will be almost six million square feet with an estimated 6,500 workers. It is estimated to reach full capacity in 2020.  And all those workers need a place to live. That's why some local realtors attribute the town's real estate activity to the factory.  Since Tesla started construction of the Gigafactory, home demand has jumped -- sales increased an average of nearly 6% in each month since the June 2014.  \"Tesla was pretty much the magic wand,\" said Michelle Plevel, a real estate agent in the Reno area, which includes Sparks. \"It created new excitement.\"  Homes in the same ZIP code of the factory are faring even better. Prices there surged 62% since November 2013.  Related: Tesla plans to unveil semi-truck and minibus next year  Home prices have been recovering across the country in the years following the 2008 housing crash.  More recently, a shortage of available homes for sale has pushed prices higher, and many housing markets are now facing an affordability issue as wages haven't kept pace.  But it's been a long and uneven recovery, with some housing markets still struggling to regain their footing.  Nevada had a particularly deep hole to climb out of and is still working to recuperate from the waves of foreclosures, short sales and abandoned homes that have weighed on its market.  \"Nevada home prices are still well below what they were in the peak of the last bubble,\" noted Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at ATTOM.  The state currently has the highest percentage of seriously underwater properties in the country at 22%. But Sparks is faring better: In Washoe County, where Sparks is located, the rate is 10%.  The job growth Tesla is bringing is a big reason the housing market is taking off. Plevel said the home buyers are spanning the economic ladder.  \"There are a lot of high-end executives coming in a buying million dollar homes ... and we have a lot of working-class buyers coming in,\" she said.  There's also been interest of Millennial residents looking to buy their first homes. \"They are super talented, educated and pretty wealthy with their incomes.\"  Related: Tesla offers to buy SolarCity for $2.6 billion  Here's another bright spot: Homes are being built. \"This is actually the first visible pulse of the recovery in the Reno area, when you start seeing construction coming out of the ground,\" said Plevel.  It's risky for a local economy to be tied too closely to a particular industry or company, but there are other big-name tech companies in the area that have helped.  Apple (AAPL, Tech30) has a large data center in Reno, and Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) also has an office in Reno.  Rapidly rising prices aren't good for everyone though.  \"The potential losers in this situation are folks who live locally and work locally, but aren't making the higher wages and may not be able to afford the higher prices,\" said Blomquist.

{"text": "Americans didn't get a raise last year. In fact, they haven't gotten one in years. The typical American family income was $53,657 in 2014, barely changed from $54,462 a year earlier, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Wednesday.  What's worse ... it's far below the peak set in 1999. That's a major reason why so many Americans are still gloomy about the economy six years into the recovery.  This was the third year in a row that median household incomes stagnated, following two years of declines. Whites saw their incomes decline 1.7%, while blacks, Hispanics and Asians saw no significant difference.  \"Clearly, the improving economy and falling unemployment have yet to adequately lift the living standards of middle- and low-incomes,\" Jared Bernstein, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote on his blog.  Median income remains lower than it was in 2007, Census said. Precise comparisons, however, are now difficult because Census changed its methodology last year so it could provide a more detailed look at the sources of Americans' income.  The holding pattern in wages comes despite the fact that millions more Americans are working. Some 1.2 million more men and 1.6 million more women are working full-time, year-round, respectively.  The earnings of women who work full time were essentially the same as they were in 2007, while men's earnings were 2.2% lower.  Wage stagnation is a central focus of the 2016 presidential election. The Democratic candidates want to raise the minimum wage and widen the safety net, while Republicans want to spur job creation by lowering taxes and shedding regulations.  Poverty remains high   Meanwhile, the nation's poverty rate also held steady at 14.8% last year. Some 46.7 million Americans were in poverty, compared to 46.3 million in 2013.  In 2014, the weighted average poverty threshold for a family of four was $24,230.  The poverty rate remained flat after dropping in 2013, which was the first decline since it shot up during the Great Recession. A lot of the decrease had come from people finding full-time work -- and thus earning more money.  Some 26.2% of blacks were in poverty in 2014 and 23.6% of Hispanics, essentially unchanged from a year earlier. For whites, the rate was 10.1%.  More than 1 in 5 American children were in poverty, essentially unchanged from a year earlier.  That the poverty rate remains so elevated years after the recession ended is disappointing, said Robert Doar, fellow in poverty studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.  \"The recovery is anemic and slower than the typical recovery,\" said Doar.  The Census Bureau also released an alternate poverty measure that takes into account various government benefits and expenses not captured by the official poverty rate. The so-called Supplemental Poverty Measure showed 15.3% of Americans were in poverty last year, not statistically different than a year earlier.  Work-related costs such as transportation and child care, as well as medical and tax expenses drove more people into poverty, the report showed. These costs outweighed the benefit of non-cash public assistance, such as food stamps, housing vouchers and refundable tax credits, which have helped lift many Americans out of poverty in the past.  This alternate measure shows the importance of refundable tax credits -- including the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, which go to low- and moderate-income workers, said Jane Waldfogel, a Columbia University professor and author of forthcoming book, Too Many Children Left Behind.  These credits helped to lower children's poverty rate to 16.7% under the alternate measure.  Millions more have health coverage   The Census Bureau also reported that the uninsured rate fell to 10.4% in 2014, the first year people could sign up for coverage on the Obamacare exchange or through Medicaid expansion in many states. That's down from 13.3% the year before. Nearly 9 million more people had health coverage in 2014 than a year earlier.  But more recent government data found that the uninsured rate fell to 9.2% in the first quarter of this year, which marks the first time in decades the uninsured rate has dropped below 10%. Some 29 million people lacked coverage, down 7 million from a year earlier, the report found.  Not surprisingly, Wednesday's Census data shows the largest increases in coverage came in Medicaid and direct-purchase plans, which includes those bought on the Obamacare exchange.  Hispanics continued to have the highest uninsured rate, at 19.9%, followed by blacks at 11.8%. Both dropped by more than 4 percentage points from 2013. The Obama administration has focused on signing up Hispanics and blacks for Medicaid or Obamacare plans, though advocacy groups have been somewhat disappointed with the results.  Non-Hispanic whites' uninsured rate was 7.6%. ", "date": "September 16, 2015: 5:35 PM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/16/news/economy/census-poverty-income/", "author": "Tami Luhby"},

{"text": "Think you are too smart to be replaced by a robot in your job? Think again. Experts are warning that skilled jobs will soon start disappearing because of the rise of artificial intelligence.  So far, robots have mainly been replacing manual labor, performing routine and intensive tasks. But smarter machines are putting more skilled professions at risk.  Robots are likely to be performing 45% of manufacturing tasks by 2025, versus just 10% today, according to a study by Bank of America. And the rise of artificial intelligence will only accelerate that process as the number of devices connected to the Internet doubles to 50 billion by 2020.  By the same year, nearly half of all U.S. jobs will be at high risk of being lost to computers, according to experts at Oxford University, with an additional 20% facing medium risk. Jobs previously thought of as secure and now considered at risk include data analysts and bankers.  The prices of robots and computers are falling, making them even more attractive to employers. Costs have declined by 27% over the past decade and are expected to drop by another 22% in the next decade, the Bank of America report stated.  And as robots become easier to use, with features like machine learning, and voice and facial recognition, they're becoming a more viable alternative in jobs where people deal with customers.  Related: Forget drones, here come delivery robots  Countries that can adopt new technology early will get a big boost from lower labor costs and higher productivity.  Japan is leading the way. There are already 1,520 robots per 10,000 employees in Japan's car plants, compared to only 66 per 10,000 worldwide.  China is eager too -- the country has been the biggest buyer of robots for the last two years, and now accounts for 25% of global demand.  Related: Best jobs for work-life balance  The coming revolution could dramatically transform the global economy, and increase inequality. That's because most of the jobs set to disappear are lower paid, with medium skills, economists have warned.  Of course, this is not the first time that technology has radically transformed the workforce. During the Industrial Revolution, many manual laborers were forced to \"skill up\" and move into more sophisticated jobs. But the report warns this time could be different.  Workers in skilled positions may be forced to take jobs they are overqualified to do but which can't easily be performed by a machine.  Could you lose your job to robots?   Here are some examples of jobs most at risk: Administrative staff, manual workers, data processing jobs.

{"text": "Where you live can have a big impact on your future prosperity. That's because the country's most expensive housing markets have appreciated at a much faster clip in the last 30 years than homes in the country's least expensive markets.  Home prices in the priciest cities have increased two times as fast as those in the least expensive areas, according to a Trulia report released Wednesday. (See editor's note below)  In 1986, the average home price in the nation's most expensive markets was $127,058. That's 144% higher than the average home price of $52,022 in the least expensive real estate markets.  Fast forward to 2016, and the average home price in the costliest markets is $493,504 -- nearly 320% higher than the current $117,827 home price average in the lowest priced markets.  That means buyers who are able to purchase a home in the expensive places have seen a much bigger return on their investments, and will likely be able to pass along more wealth to future generations.  Related: San Francisco is expensive and residents are over it  Take for example San Francisco, which was the most expensive place to buy in 1986 and 2016: The typical buyer who purchased 30 years ago and has since paid off the mortgage, has seen home values increase by nearly $900,000.  In Dayton, Ohio, which was among the markets with the smallest return on home value over the last three decades, buyers have seen a $51,789 change in their median home values.  \"That is a huge discrepancy,\" noted Ralph McLaughlin, Trulia's chief economist. \"If you have children and you are going to pass down those gains, you can do a lot more with $900,000 than $50,000.\"  And the price gap between the most and least expensive housing markets isn't going to close any time soon.  \"If there are going to be changes to inequality, we are talking generations rather than decades,\" McLaughlin noted.  Related: Men are making more money off their homes than women  The main factors driving up home values is income growth and housing supply, according to the report.  The more expensive markets tend to have higher incomes, which can push up home prices since buyers are able to afford more and compete against each other.  The pricier cities also tend to have less building activity, which can limit supply and drive up prices when demand increases.  And when housing costs increase, local employers increase wages in order to retain talent.  Homeownership brought the smallest gains in Rochester, New York, according to the report, where buyers gained 85% of their home's value since 1986.  There have only been four changes to the list of the 20 most expensive during the past 30 years: Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Denver and Washington, D.C. They replaced Dallas; Hartford, Connecticut; Worcester, Massachusetts and Riverside, California.  Here are the areas that have seen the biggest return on home values since 1986:  1. San Francisco  2. San Jose, California  3. Honolulu, Hawaii  4. Seattle  5. Portland, Oregon  6. Oakland, California  7. Orange County, California  8. Los Angeles  9. San Diego  10. Miami  Editor's note: An earlier version of this story showed that home values in the most expensive markets have appreciated 10 times as fast as those in the least expensive markets. Trulia has corrected their report to show that expensive markets have appreciated two times as fast as the least expensive.

For the first time since 2011, incomes rose faster than home prices in the U.S., according to a new report from Zillow.  The median home price climbed to $188,100 in August, a 5% increase from the same time a year ago.  And last week, the Census Bureau reported that median household income increased to $56,516 in 2015, up 5.2% from 2014.  \"People will have a chance to see more money coming in on a monthly basis in their paychecks, allowing them to save more for a down payment or afford more in a mortgage payment,\" said Svenja Gudell, Zillow's chief economist.  Related: How much house can you afford?  While the rise in income -- which was the first increase since 2007 -- is good news for wanna-be home buyers, incomes still have a long way to go to catch up with home values.  Home prices have shot up since 2012, as strong demand and limited supply created an affordability issue in markets throughout the country.  In the wake of the 2008 housing crisis, banks also stiffened their lending standards, including down payment requirements. Higher prices mean larger down payments, which are a major obstacle for many potential buyers.  Mortgage rates hovering near record lows have helped ease some of the price pain. The average rate of a 30-year fixed mortgage is 3.48%, according to Freddie Mac. A year ago, the rate was 3.86%.  Related: Homes in these ZIP codes are selling like crazy  While home appreciation is slowing nationwide, some markets are still on fire.  Prices in Portland, Oregon; Seattle and Denver experienced double-digit annual growth. For instance, in Portland, home prices are up nearly 15% year over year to hit $338,900.  Renters are also starting to see some relief.  Rising home prices had pushed more people into the rental market, which in turn caused rental prices to soar.  Right now, rents are growing 1.7% nationally, according to Zillow.  A year ago, rents were rising by more than 6%.

{"text": "Alibaba officially became the biggest initial public offering of all time, confirming on Monday that in the final tally it raised an eye-popping $25 billion. The e-commerce giant's ability to raise huge sums of cash could give stock prices further momentum in the medium term. Investors are still hungry.  Alibaba's (BABA, Tech30) decision to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange should also reinforce Wall Street's central role in the global finance world despite pushes by London and Hong Kong. Plus, four of the top six investment banks tapped to underwrite the Alibaba IPO are U.S. firms.  But don't forget, Alibaba is a Chinese company with very little presence in the U.S. at this point.  That means the positive ripple effects from the IPO -- like a real estate boom and luxury car sales as newly wealthy executives make purchases -- are largely being felt in Asia, not Silicon Valley.  \"If it was a U.S. corporation, the proceeds would be coming back into the U.S. economy and there would be a multiplier effect. We're only seeing a little bit of that,\" said David Weild, the former vice chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market.  Related: Should you buy shares of Alibaba?  When Facebook (FB, Tech30) went public in May 2012, it made many early employees and investors millionaires virtually overnight. Some, like Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, even became billionaires.  Those newly-rich people, many of them still in their 20s, quickly scooped up luxury cars and trucks, mansions and yachts.  \"There was a big real estate wealth effect in the San Francisco area as a result of the Facebook IPO. It had a very beneficial effect on the northern California economy,\" said Weild, who is currently chairman and CEO of IssuWorks.  The Facebook IPO also benefited financial advisors in the Silicon Valley region, who rushed to cater to the needs of the new tech millionaires.   Related: Defense stocks rally as ISIS crisis escalates  But with Alibaba, many of the early employees and some of its early investors are based in China.  Alibaba \"is creating a positive psychology for the stock market, the IPO market in general and probably for the U.S. economy. It's terrific in that regard. But not as terrific as if it were a U.S. company where all of that capital would stay on our shores,\" said Weild.  It's also worth remembering that New York wasn't Alibaba's preferred destination for its IPO. Alibaba only decided to list in the U.S. after Hong Kong refused to amend its rules for the Chinese company's unusual corporate structure, which gives regular investors less power than typical stocks.  Alibaba was not a positive factor for the stock market at all on Monday.  Related: Investors are scared again  Alibaba fell over 4% and dropped well below the $92.70 price it opened at on Friday.

{"text": "Call it the anti-Uber model. Office cleaning startup Managed by Q is taking a different approach to the service economy. \"Q\" -- as its employees refer to it -- takes a tech-enabled approach to cleaning. Its business customers rely on it to keep track of cleaning and office supplies, request handymen, and schedule cleanings. It's all managed via an iPad.  And Managed by Q hires its employees.  That's a different approach from Uber and the majority of on-demand firms. They rely on contract workers -- which means they don't have to offer benefits, sick leave or guaranteed hours.  The contract worker structure has been under fire. Just this week it came to light that the California Labor Commission said a San Francisco Uber driver was, in fact, an employee. This case could have significant implications for Uber and others with similar models.  Q offers a starting wage of $12.50 per hour in New York, for example, plus benefits like 401k plans, flexible hours and even free college courses. Wages for maintenance duties start at $40 per hour.  \"We realized fairly early on that in order to deliver the best quality of service, we needed to be the best employer,\" said Q co-founder Dan Teran, 26.  On Thursday, the startup closed $15 million in a Series A round of funding led by RRE Ventures. It also announced its expansion to San Francisco, where over 200 companies were already on the waitlist. (It was previously available in New York and Chicago.)  The startup, which launched in December 2013, already has over 150 employees. They're adamant not just about rapid growth, but creating a company that employees want to stay at long term.  \"One of the fundamental principles is that we do not have a divide between our headquarters and our labor,\" said co-founder Saman Rahmanian, 33. \"All of us are operators. We have office operators and field operators.\"  All workers have access to Q's headquarters -- to grab a coffee or just relax in between shifts. The company also offers on-the-job training.  \"You can have people progress from the field into the office,\" said Rahmanian. \"If you have a divide, you're limiting their progression.\"  Q's approach could serve to mitigate the ennui that contract workers often feel.  Flexible work hours is the number one reason why workers picked their current employer, according to a recent study of 1,000 contractors who've worked for companies like Uber and Lyft. It even outweighed factors like higher pay and location.  \"No one says as an employer you can't let people choose their hours,\" said Teran. \"It's a choice you make as an employer.\"  Q lets its employees work a set weekly schedule if they prefer, but it also lets them pick up last-minute shifts or cancel with 48 hours notice. And its employees seem content: it's had less than 1% turnover.  Its novel approach could be a major shift in the market.  \"The mainstream [model] is to use contract workers, but it's hard in an environment like Managed by Q,\" said Zeynep Ton, a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management.  Ton researches how organizations can best run their businesses to suit needs of employees, customers, and investors, which she refers to as \"operational excellence.\" She was so intrigued by Q that she is now an adviser to the company.  It's significant for the startup. Her book, The Good Jobs Strategy, informed a lot of Q's policies, said Teran.  That's why Ton is planning to conduct a case study at MIT to see how Q's model -- hiring employees instead of working with contractors -- scales as the company does.  Ton said for the model to work, it'll require a continued investment in people.  \"There's definitely more upfront costs and you have to be more careful about growth,\" said Ton. \"[But Q's model] could have a big potential impact -- especially in the startup world.\"  Q's founders say they're up for the challenge.  \"We're focused on becoming the best employer in the world,\" said Teran.

{"text": "Alibaba has disclosed that it is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over its accounting practices and how it reports data from its blockbuster Singles' Day sale. The Chinese e-commerce firm said it has been told that regulators are looking for potential violations of federal securities laws. The SEC has requested documents and information on a logistics firm with close ties to Alibaba and data reporting from the company's sale on Singles' Day, which is China's version of Black Friday or Cyber Monday.  \"This matter is ongoing, and, as with any regulatory proceeding, we cannot predict when it will be concluded,\" Alibaba said in a regulatory filing. Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) shares dropped nearly 3% in premarket trading.  The focus of the SEC probe was not immediately clear, but critics have in the past complained that Alibaba reports Singles' Day sales in terms of gross merchandise volume, or GMV.  GMV tallies the monetary value of buying activity over a certain period of time, but it doesn't take into account various hiccups -- for example, customer returns, or if the seller runs out of stock and can't deliver the product. Last year, the Hangzhou-based firm reported GMV sales of $14.3 billion on Singles' Day.  The other focus of the SEC's probe is Cainiao Network, a logistics and distribution platform that handles the vast majority of Alibaba's deliveries. Alibaba owns a 47% stake in the firm, which recently raised 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) from investors.

{"text": "For 13 years, Apple (AAPL, Tech30) wowed investors with consistent sales growth fueled by the iPod, iPad and, more than anything else, the iPhone -- which accounts for the majority of the company's revenue. No longer.  Apple posted sales of $42.4 billion for the quarter that ended in June, down from $49.6 billion a year earlier, according to the earnings report on Tuesday. The company's profits also fell by more than 25% from the same period a year earlier.  That marks the second straight quarter where Apple's sales have declined year-over-year as iPhone sales peter out.  Sales of the iPhone fell to 40.4 million units, down from 48 million a year earlier. On the bright side, Apple's sales declined a little less than Wall Street had expected, sending the stock up as much 7% in after hours trading.  Welcome to the new Apple, where success is defined as not having sales fall even more.  Customers are taking longer to upgrade their phones. Many analysts have raised concerns that the global smartphone market is saturated. And overall sales in China, touted as Apple's next big market, fell by a third from the previous year.  \"We remain very optimistic about the long-term possibilities in greater China,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on a conference call with analysts Tuesday. In particular, he noted that there are now 41 Apple Stores in China.  Related: 'Carpool Karaoke' series will be exclusively on Apple Music  Cook also admitted on the call that Apple was caught off guard by the slower rate of customers upgrading to the iPhone 6S, which was released last fall. \"Maybe that was a predictable thing, although we didn't predict it in the beginning,\" he said. \"It took us a little time to realize that.\"  Expectations were low leading up to the earnings report. Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners, went so far as to pen a \"haiku\" in an investor note this week: \"It has become clear, that the muse that drove Apple, has gone somewhere else.\"  There were some bright spots in the report: iPad revenue grew year-over-year thanks to the introduction of the pricier iPad Pro. Cook also highlighted sales growth in its services division -- meaning iTunes, the App Store and Apple Pay -- by saying he expects it to make as much as a \"Fortune 100\" company by next year.  Translation: Even if Apple doesn't keep increasing the number of devices it sells, it could still make more money from the people who use those devices via these services.  Cook also took a moment to talk up the \"incredible\" phenomenon of Pokemon Go, which broke Apple download records. \"It ... does show that [augmented reality] can be really great,\" he said, before noting that Apple is investing in augmented reality.  This quarter is typically Apple's weakest of the year. It is the last one before the next iPhone model is released in the fall.  \"We don't expect this report to serve as a meaningful catalyst for the stock, as all eyes are on the iPhone 7 launch in September,\" Simona Jankowski, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note ahead of the earnings report.  Apple will reportedly break with its usual strategy of overhauling the iPhone every two years. The next generation iPhone is expected to ditch the headphone jack, but otherwise only receive small tweaks compared to the models on the market.

{"text": "Alibaba smashed its own \"Singles' Day\" record on Wednesday, ending the world's single biggest shopping day with sales of $14.3 billion. It's a staggering figure -- but is it the best gauge of Alibaba's success?  The sales figure, reported in terms of gross merchandise volume (GMV), was 60% higher than last year.  But here's the thing: Experts say that GMV doesn't always paint a complete picture, even though e-commerce firms like Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) and Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) frequently use the measurement.  GMV tallies the monetary value of buying activity over a certain period of time, but it doesn't take into account various hiccups -- for example, customer returns, or if the seller runs out of stock and can't deliver the product. That means final sales numbers will likely be lower.  \"With a sales holiday like this, because there is a lot of impulse purchasing and a lot of gifting, there is no guarantee that people are going to end up liking the product,\" said China Market Research's Ben Cavender.  \"Alibaba does see a spike in returns following these sales days,\" he said. \"Once you start dealing with returns, it's going to wipe out most of your margins from the sales in the first place.\"  Related: Chinese shoppers fuel baby formula shortage in Australia  Think about it this way: After paying $300 for three pairs of shoes, a customer decides they only like one pair, and returns the others. The transaction generates $300 in terms of GMV, even though the customer spent only $100.  Alibaba wouldn't specify how many returns it receives, but a spokeswoman said \"the number of returns to the entire GMV is miniscule.\" Alibaba shares fell 2% on Wednesday in New York.  The other thing to remember is that $14 billion in GMV doesn't translate to $14 billion in revenue for Alibaba. The company makes its money from fees or commissions paid by sellers on its online portals.  For Alibaba, GMV \"doesn't mean that much, because it's no guarantee of the money they're going to make off the transaction,\" Cavender said.  Still, the metric highlights the massive buying power of Chinese consumers, who continue to spend despite slower economic growth in the country.  Alibaba and its rivals are gunning to get a bigger slice of the market. China is already one of the largest online retail markets in the world, and the fastest-growing. The industry brought in roughly $210 billion in 2012, and is expected to hit $650 billion by 2020, according to McKinsey.

{"text": "Imagine a table of diners at a high-end restaurant, getting up and leaving after their meal without leaving a tip. Sound like a case of rude customers or poor service? It could just be the future of dining out, as more restaurants implement no-tipping policies, and use alternative menu pricing to compensate employees.  \"There is a growing movement to change the way tipped workers are paid,\" said Jay Holland, government affairs coordinator at the New York State Restaurant Association.  Starting Jan. 1, patrons of Bar Agricole and its sister restaurant Trou Normand in San Francisco will not be expected to leave a tip.  Instead, owner Thad Vogler has decided to increase his menu prices by 20% to pay the staff and eliminate any end-of-dinner math calculations.  \"It's time for the restaurant business to be more like every other industry and charge what's appropriate rather than relying on other people to compensate its workers,\" said Vogler.   These 10 food trends could dominate 2015  Nearly 2,400 miles away in Newport, K.Y., customers of meatball shop Packhouse are also not expected to leave a tip at the end of their meal.  \"We are in a competitive industry and we thought this could be a point of differentiation and originality,\" said owner Bob Conway. \"The customer won't feel the whammy at the end of their experience.\"  He built tax and gratuity into his menu prices when he opened the restaurant at the start of 2014. The wait staff makes either $10 an hour or 20% of sales (whichever is higher) and Conway said his servers average about $16.50 an hour.  These restaurateurs aren't alone in their move to end tipping.  And while it isn't yet widespread, the movement is particularly catching on in many restaurants in major metropolitan areas.  How much should you tip housekeeping? A travel tipping guide  But no-tip policies are still far from the norm, and have a long way to go before becoming widely accepted.  \"This will be the most controversial and most discussed movement of the next year,\" predicted Andrew Freeman, president of restaurant consulting firm AF&Co.  Part of the controversy relates to whether workers will get shorted.  Federal law requires employers to pay tipped workers $2.13 an hour as long as their total compensation (including tips) equals the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. And some states have issued their own minimum wage laws specific to tipped workers.  Holland said getting rid of tips could be bad for some servers. \"The workers who are earning more than minimum wage could actually be getting a decrease in their take-home pay if they weren't allowed to get tips,\" he said.  Another issue is whether customers will feel the level of service could decline if waitstaff aren't working for tips.  \"Most people complaining tend to not like the perceived control they are losing over customer service,\" Volger said.  But most diners don't tend to give tips based solely on service, according to Martin O'Neill, Hotel and Restaurant Management program director at Auburn. \"People tip regardless. It's more societal pressure that weighs on the decision.\"  Guess who's expecting a holiday tip this year...  Getting rid of tipping is easier said than done since it's a practice that's become so engrained in our culture.  In Packhouse, despite a sign on the floor when you come in the front door and a note in the menu about the policy, Conway said some of his customers can't walk away without leaving something.  \"It's usually just a few dollars, and that's fine, but we try to explain that our servers are very well compensated.\" ", "date": "December 23, 2014: 9:57 AM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/23/luxury/no-tipping-policy/", "author": "Kathryn Vasel"},
{"text": "Miami, New York City, Los Angeles. These are great American cities with rich cultural histories. Their iconic skylines are well known in movies and street signs, and they attract tourists and celebrities from around the world.  But they also have the unfortunate distinction of being three of the most unequal places in America. The gap between the rich and the poor is vast.  In the New York City metropolitan area, roughly four million people live on $12,300 or less, according to Census Bureau data. That's below the poverty line for a family. On the flip side, New York is also home to the most billionaires in the world.  The reality is these grand cities symbolize the American Dream around the world, but the day-to-day reality leaves many behind.  As the conversation about income inequality rises in America, it's worth taking a look at where the gap is the biggest...and the smallest.  Related: What economic equality looks like in America  New York doesn't actually top the list of cities with big inequality problems. That distinction goes to Bridgeport-Stamford, Connecticut, an area that is home to many hedge funds and investment managers.  In that metropolitan area in Connecticut, the richest 20% of households hold nearly 60% of the city's income. No other American urban area has that amount of wealth concentrated in the hands of the elite.  To put it in perspective, in the big U.S. metropolitan area with the least inequality (Ogden-Clearfield, Utah), the wealthiest 20% of households only take in about 40% of the income.  How do economists determine inequality? When people try to compare cities -- or even countries -- based on how much inequality there is, they look at something known as the Gini Coefficient. Named after an Italian economist, Corrado Gini, this metric takes into account how much income the wealthy, middle class and poor hold.  A Gini Coefficient of 0 would mean that everyone in the town had the same income. A coefficient of 1 would signal that one person or family had just about everything while everyone else had nothing.  Related: Black-white wealth gap widens  The United States overall has a Gini Coefficient of 0.45. America's 10 metropolitan areas with the greatest inequality have Gini Coefficients of about 0.5 (Los Angeles, CA) to 0.55 (Bridgeport-Stamford, Conn.), according to the most recent Census data.  The 'best' cities: While Americans are increasingly aware of inequality, few take the time to look at the other side the equation: Which cities appear to be getting it right? Where is the gap between the rich and the poor slimmer?  Many of these urban areas -- while having at least 300,000 residents -- are not as well known. They are places like Anchorage, Alaska and Salem, Oregon. They are economic hubs for their states, but they tend not to have as many Fortune 500 type companies and the large executive salaries that go with them.  The gulf between what the poorest residents earn and the wealthiest is noticeably smaller in these locales. The income of the poor is clearly higher in most of these 10 cities and, even more strikingly, the elite typically earn $356,000 or less.  Of course, each city has to be considered on a case-by-case basis. There are negative reasons why a city could end up having a low Gini Coefficient. Honolulu, Hawaii looks like one of the best when looking at Gini metrics, but the high cost of living in the state can make life even more difficult for the poor.  Similarly, an area like Gulfport-Biloxi, Miss. has lower incomes, on average, than much of the rest of the country. Depressed wages are a different kind of economic problem.

{"text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook is urging passage of a federal law that would protect workers from facing discrimination based on their sexual orientation. In an op-ed column in Monday's Wall Street Journal, Cook writes that protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers is a good business practice that should be recognized in federal law.  \"For too long, too many people have had to hide that part of their identity in the workplace,\" he wrote. \"Those who have suffered discrimination have paid the greatest price for this lack of legal protection. But ultimately we all pay a price. If our co-workers cannot be themselves in the workplace, they certainly cannot be their best selves.\"  At issue is the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, known as ENDA, which faces a key vote in the Senate on Monday.  The bill cleared a Senate procedural vote late Tuesday. Supporters are hoping the bill passes the Senate, which it could do with the support of all 55 Democratic senators and at least a handful of Republicans. Legislation needs 60 votes in the Senate to avoid being subject to a filibuster.  While the majority of U.S. workers live in states that bar employment discrimination based on sexual orientation, 29 states still allow employers to fire workers based on their sexual orientation. An additional four states allow the firing of transgender workers even if gay employees have protection.  The federal law would protect both gay and transgender employees.  While chances for passage in the Democratic-controlled Senate look good, the outlook is less clear in the Republican-controlled House. Many conservative groups, including the Heritage Foundation and the Family Research Council, are actively fighting the legislation.  Cook, who became CEO of Apple in 2011, has typically not taken positions on public issues outside of those directly affecting Apple's operations, such as taxation of multinational corporations.

More than 90% of the Fortune 500 companies have adopted written nondiscrimination policies explicitly prohibiting harassment and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a group that is pushing for the legislation.  But public support for ENDA has been more limited. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been neutral on the legislation.  Exxon Mobil shareholders recently rejected a shareholder proposal that would have offered explicit protections to LGBT workers. Exxon Mobil management had argued the measure was unnecessary due to its existing prohibition against discrimination.

{"text": "Don't have tens of thousands of dollars in savings? That doesn't mean there's no hope of becoming a homeowner. Home prices are on the rise, making it harder for buyers to cobble together a 20% down payment.  With the national average listing price for a four-bedroom, two-bathroom home at $302,632, according to Coldwell Banker Real Estate, home buyers need to come up with $60,526 to put 20% down.  But there are options for buyers who don't have that kind of cash sitting in the bank.  1. Apply for an FHA loan  The Federal Housing Administration backs mortgages that require as little as 3.5% down.  Anyone can apply, though you'll usually need good credit.  There are a few downsides though. For starters, the lower down payments can mean more paperwork and will translate into higher monthly payments since borrowers are financing more, warned real estate broker Brendon DeSimone.  Plus, you'll need to pay mortgage insurance on the loan in addition to your principal and interest, which raises monthly payments even more.  But those extra payments are lower than they once were. At the start of 2015, the government reduced mortgage insurance premiums on some FHA loans, which increased the pool of borrowers.  \"The fee change made more people see the FHA option as a financial alternative,\" said according to Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Realtor.com.  Related: Ready to buy a home?  2. Look to see what Uncle Sam offers.   The Department of Veteran's Affairs guarantees home loans with 0% down for current and former service members.  The loans come with competitive interest rates and no private mortgage insurance premium, but borrowers could pay some fees at closing.  The Department of Agriculture has a home loan program to increase homeownership in more rural and less-populated areas. USDA loans do not require putting any money down, but there are eligibility requirements, including income and property size.  Many cities and municipalities offer down payment assistance programs to help potential buyers, according to Smoke. \"Some of the programs are based on profession, where you are living, income qualification ratios ... they want to encourage people to buy.\"  3. Ask family members for a loan.   Tapping a relative for a large sum of money can be awkward, but setting up a loan is sometimes an enticing offer for both parties.  With many retirees earning very little interest on their money, a personal mortgage can offer a steady stream of income.  \"If a parent has the money in an interest-bearing account earning darn near zero, this might be an option to increase their yield and help their child out at the same time,\" said Eric Hutchinson, certified financial planner at United Capital Financial Advisers.  Experts advise laying out the loan terms, including a payback schedule and interest rate, in writing. To make a loan legitimate to the IRS, the interest rate needs to be comparable to what banks charge.  \"Consider your child a junk bond ... take a 10-year Treasury note yield and add two to three percent,\" advised Timothy Watters, certified financial planner at Watters Financial Services.  Buyers will have to disclose all loans to their mortgage lender.  4. Get the money gifted  Some well-off parents would rather see their inheritance money in action while they're still alive, said Hutchinson.  The gift tax is currently $14,000 per person, which means a parent can give a married couple up to $28,000, without triggering taxes.   Borrowers that go this route will have to provide their mortgage issuer with a letter from the giver that states the money doesn't have to be repaid, and may need to show their financial statements as well.  5. Dip into retirement funds ... cautiously  Another place to look for the money: try tapping your retirement account, if you have one. But use caution to avoid paying penalties.  Some 401(k) plans allow participants to take out 50% of their vested balance (up to $50,000) as a tax-free loan, according to Hutchinson. The loan needs to be repaid on a given timeline -- usually five years. But there's a big caveat: If you leave the company before the loan is paid back, you will likely owe the entire balance within 60 days. If you can't pay, the amount will be treated as an early withdrawal and you'll owe regular income taxes, plus a penalty.  Qualified first-time home buyers can also tap a traditional IRA account up to $10,000 without facing the 10% penalty. You will pay taxes on the amount withdrawn. If you have a Roth IRA and it's been open for at least five years, the distribution (up to $10,000) is tax free. Roths also allow you to withdraw your contributions for any reason without incurring tax or a penalty.  Have you recently achieved a financial goal? Paid off debt? Built up a large savings account?

{"text": "Carried interest, flat tax and fair tax. The Republican candidates for president have been throwing around a lot of unfamiliar terms as they roll out their plans to reform the nation's tax system. And they'll likely talk more about these proposals at Wednesday's debates on CNN.  Most of them involve lowering taxes. That is the key to boosting economic growth in the Republican playbook, after all.  CNNMoney explains what all the jargon means.  Carried interest: Hedge fund managers are the latest target for some GOP candidates. Real estate mogul Donald Trump and Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, want to crack down on an IRS loophole that allows hedge fund honchos to list their profits as \"carried interest\" instead of income. So these earnings are taxed as capital gains, which carry a top rate of 20%, plus a 3.8% surtax, instead of as wages, which currently have a top tax rate of 39.6%, plus a 2.9% Medicare tax.  \"We're going to be reducing taxes for the middle class, but for the hedge fund guys, they're going to be paying up,\" Trump said on CBS' Face the Nation Sunday. \"...they pay very little tax, and that's going to end.\"  The candidates are not the first to suggest raising taxes on hedge fund managers. On several occasions, President Obama has proposed taxing carried interest at ordinary income rates, a plan the Treasury Department estimated would bring in $18 billion over 10 years. So far, these proposals have gone nowhere.  Flat tax: Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Texas Senator Ted Cruz all favor a flat tax. They would jettison the tiered rates of the current system and replace them with a single rate on income.  Paul says he would institute a 14.5% rate on all personal income, including wages, capital gains, dividends and interest. He'd get rid of the payroll tax. He'd also levy a 14.5% tax on business revenues, compared to the current top corporate tax rate of 35%. But he would also eliminate businesses' current ability to deduct wages. That would likely lead to employers reducing salaries and raises, said Joseph Rosenberg, senior research associate at Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan research group.  Carson, on the other hand, says his flat tax rate would be between 10% and 15%. He likens it to tithing, or donating 10% of your income to the church.  Cruz hasn't offered details on his plan yet, but has said it would be so easy that Americans can file their returns on a postcard. He also wants to eliminate the Internal Revenue Service.  The main problem with the flat tax system is that the rate would have to be at least 25% to bring in as much revenue as today's system, said Rosenberg. But Paul has said he doesn't see that as a problem since he wants to greatly reduce the size of the federal budget anyway.  Another criticism of the flat tax is that it's generally seen as a giveaway to the wealthiest Americans.  \"You are reducing taxes by far the most at the very high end,\" said Rosenberg.  Fair tax: Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, is pushing the Fair Tax, which he says will solve many of the nation's fiscal issues, including the shaky finances of Social Security and Medicare.  The proposal calls for replacing income and capital gains taxes, as well as payroll taxes, with a national sales tax. The rate would be 23%, but it means that out of a $1 purchase, 23 cents would be in taxes. Most would consider it a 30% sales tax: 23 cents on top of the original 77-cent purchase.  \"The Fair Tax transforms the process by which we fund Social Security and Medicare because the money paid in consumption is paid by everybody, including illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people that are freeloading off the system now,\" he said at the August GOP candidates' debate.  The idea is that tax evaders and those involved in the sex trade and other illegal activities don't pay taxes on the income they earn. But under a Fair Tax, they'd have to pay taxes on the items they buy, just like everyone else.  But many experts -- on both sides of the political aisle -- say the Fair Tax wouldn't bring in the same amount of revenue as the current tax system.  \"The rate is just not enough to replace all the revenue they want to eliminate,\" said Alan Viard, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.

Buying a home is a better financial move for men than women, as the average market value of homes owned by single men is 10% higher than homes owned by single women, according to a new report from RealtyTrac.

{"text": "Famous investor Jim Chanos thinks Alibaba's accounting looks shady -- even by China's standards. \"The accounting at Alibaba is some of the most questionable I've ever seen\" for a major company, Chanos said of the world's largest retailer.  Chanos' crusade against Alibaba could be self-motivated. After all, he has a lot to gain if Alibaba's stock tanks. That's because Chanos has a negative bet -- or is \"short\" -- Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) stock since last November.  But people don't just brush aside what Chanos says. He is the well-known billionaire short-seller who made his career by being early to see the problems that led to Enron's collapse in an accounting scandal early last decade.  Speaking this week at the SALT hedge fund conference in Las Vegas, Chanos expanded on his bearish view, complaining about a lack of transparency and Alibaba's \"exploding\" capital spending. Chanos said he challenges anyone to tell him if the business is truly profitable or not.  The fact that Alibaba is based in China only increases Chanos' skepticism.  \"I default to my view on China: If there's something you don't see, 99% of the time it's not good news,\" he said.  In addition, Chanos believes Alibaba uses off-balance-sheet entities that make it difficult to know how much money the company actually makes. Chanos is concerned that Alibaba's delivery operations are part of a separate entity not included in its financial statements, says Fortune. Chanos seemed to be referring to Cainiao Network, the logistics and distribution network Alibaba owns a stake in.  While Alibaba declined to comment directly to CNNMoney on the Chanos comments, the company did note that it recently began to break out the results of Cainiao, which is made up of a network of companies that employs an estimated 1.5 million people and handles an average of 30 million packages a day.  Alibaba reported a loss of $15 million for Cainiao last quarter. Those losses were offset by accounting gains tied to the fact that the division got a higher valuation when it recently raised about $1.5 billion in March. Alibaba said the investment was made by sovereign wealth and private equity firms, including GIC, Temasek and Primavera.  \"We believe that Cainiao Network's successful fund raising validates its standalone business model and future potential,\" Alibaba said in the earnings release.  Still, this is not the first time accounting questions have been raised about Alibaba. In 2014 potential accounting problems were discovered by Alibaba at its recently-acquired film division. Alibaba Pictures Group said at the time it may not have fully complied with accounting requirements and may have under reported losses.  Last September Barron's raised questions about the company's numbers in a story titled \"Alibaba: Why it could fall 50% further.\"  MarketWatch too noted at the time that the Hong Kong division of PwC that audits Alibaba has not been inspected by the U.S. audit regulator due to restrictions from China's government. PwC did not respond to a request for comment from CNNMoney.  However, Alibaba pushed back strongly to the Barron's article, saying it contained \"factual inaccuracies\" and the company \"stands by our reporting financials and operating metrics.\"  It's also worth noting that many Wall Street analysts seem to be big believers in Alibaba. Nearly three-quarters of the analysts covering Alibaba have buy or overweight ratings on the stock, according to FactSet.  Related: Oil billionaire: I'd cut off Muslims from coming to America  And as noted, Chanos is not exactly an independent source here. He is a longtime China bear, realizing as early as 2009 that the country's debt-fueled economy was due for a big setback. He was right. China's economy is now growing at the slowest pace in seven years.   Asked by a reporter if China is doing worse than \"we\" think it is, Chanos said yes and joked, \"China is worse than even I think it is.\"  Chanos said China's explosive economic growth of recent decades was largely driven by investment and credit.  \"There's no magic here,\" Chanos said.  That's why Chanos said his hedge fund Kynikos Associates is actively betting against companies exposed to China's massive debt build-up: second-tier banks, shadow banks and asset managers.  Related: China reverts to bad old ways to prop up economy  Chanos also revealed he will vote for Hillary Clinton if she wins the Democratic nomination for president, as he expects she will. Chanos had been a vocal proponent of Vice President Joe Biden running for the White House.  Chanos called the 2016 election cycle a \"strange race\" and said many supporters of Trump at the SALT conference are backing him simply because \"they don't like Hillary.\"  \"I suspect some of that will play out on the Democratic side as well,\" he said.  --CNNMoney's Sophia Yan contributed to this report.

If a staff member brings up extra towels late at night or fulfills another request, tip $1-$5. \"If someone is coming to your floor that wouldn't ordinarily be there, give a tip,\" said Whitmore.  Related: Best hotels of 2014  Room Service: 10-15% of the bill if it's not already included. \"If it is, you can give $1-$5 to the delivery person,\" suggested Patricia Napier-Fitzpatrick, founder of the Etiquette School of New York.  Concierge: $10 or more depending on the level of engagement. Scoring hard-to-get reservations or tickets should be rewarded with more, said Napier-Fitzpatrick. There's no need to tip for dining or activity recommendations.  Out & about   Tour Guides: $5-$10 for a group tour, or 20% of the cost for a private guide. \"If it's a bus tour, don't forget to also tip the bus driver a couple bucks,\" said Napier-Fitzpatrick.

{"text": "\"Carpool Karaoke\" has a surprise passenger: Apple Music. A new series based on James Corden's incredibly popular \"Late Late Show\" bit has been scooped up by Apple Music.  The series' 16 episodes will be made available exclusively to Apple Music subscribers in a move that further expands the original content of the company's streaming music service, CBS Television Studios, which is producing the show for Apple along with Corden, announced Tuesday.  The series, which was first mentioned earlier this year, will be like its late night predecessor in that it will include celebrities singing along with a yet to be announced host.

The bit, which has included Justin Bieber and Adele, has racked up more than 830 million views on YouTube, according to CBS, and has helped define Corden as one of the biggest stars in late night television.  In the latest \"Carpool Karaoke,\" Corden drove around with First Lady Michele Obama as the two belted out Beyonce's \"Single Ladies.\" Video of that segment has been watched more than 32 million times on YouTube since last week.

{"text": "Did you remember to add your garbage collector to the holiday gifting budget? What about your Zumba instructor? 'Tis the season for gifting (and tipping), and there's a whole list of people who may be expecting a few dollars.  Early December is prime tipping time, and this year Americans are expected to give more holiday tips than last year. The surge is good news for house cleaners, hair stylists and elevator operators, but for the tipper, parting with those extra dollars can be as painful as it is charitable, according to a recent report by Care.com (CRCM), a site connecting consumers and caregivers.  Take delivery people. According to the study, 1 in 3 people wish they didn't have to tip them a little extra this holiday season. A similar sentiment goes for child care providers -- 14% of respondents wish they didn't have to include them either.  But they do. For nannies, the recommended holiday tip is one to two week's pay. For day care workers, it's $25-$50, plus a small gift from your child.  Also on the list are building superintendents, baristas, dog walkers, dry cleaning delivery people, personal trainers and school bus drivers.  How much should you tip housekeeping? A travel tipping guide   The survey showed that 17% of people tip because of expectation, compared to 73% who do it to say thank you. About 6% tip out of fear they won't get good service next year if they're stingy.  Fear should never be a factor in gifting, said Diane Gottsman, an etiquette expert. \"You should not feel blackmailed that they're not going to give quality service,\" she said. \"A gift is not an obligation.\"  Still, deciding who receives that gift can become contentious. About 15% of people said they argue with their partner about tipping, which is no surprise, given that 1 in 4 people plan to spend more than $250 in total -- a large chunk of some household budgets.  Sticking to a holiday tipping budget, and allocating cash or gifts starting with those closest to you, is the best way to handle a longer list, said Katie Bugbee of Care.com.  For those who skip the tip, there may be some savings, but it comes with a healthy side of guilt -- especially if you're a woman. Over half of the women surveyed reported feeling guilty about not tipping, compared to 39% of men.  \"Women are just feeling guilty all the time,\" Bugbee said. \"Even when they are handing out a lot of cash, they can't win.\"  Gottsman advised that when wondering where to draw the line, it's simple: If you wouldn't gift that person, don't tip them. Lists that offer guidelines for tipping should be regarded as suggestions and not rules.  5 people you might not tip (but should)   Some may not tip because they just don't have the money, which is true of 28% of respondents. Still, Bugbee said to be mindful of the message that could send.  Even if a cash tip isn't possible, send on a hand-written note or a homemade food item -- especially if it's people who work in your home. \"If you're having a very economical Christmas they'll know that and they'll see that,\" she said.  Gottsman agreed, saying that while gifting is a choice, not giving anything may leave an impression that says, \"I'm not as appreciative of you.\"  But it is the holiday season, after all. \"You give with good cheer, you give with good will,\" she said.

In the weeks before Singles' Day -- China's answer to \"Cyber Monday\" on Nov. 11 -- cans of Bellamy's Organic infant formula started disappearing from store shelves in Australia.  \"We have encountered significant activity by some people who like to buy our product here from Australian retailers and on-sell it to consumers in China,\" the company said in a statement online. \"This has contributed to limited stocks of Bellamy's products ... It's a fact that our brand is very popular in China, particularly leading up to 'Singles' Day.'\"  China's demand for foreign-produced baby formula has been growing ever since a 2008 tainted baby formula scandal led to a number of deaths and caused hundreds of thousands of others to fall ill.  Bellamy's is a popular brand in China, accounting for about one-third of baby formula sales in the country, according to the company. The company estimates that as much as 40% of its sales in Australia are servicing customer demands in China -- for example, from people who purchase abroad and privately export for resale in China.  It's a lucrative business -- one can of Bellamy's Organic formula costs around $20 in Australia, but sellers on Alibaba's Taobao.com were hawking them for at least double.  The Bellamy's shortage has occurred even though many stores have limited the number of tins consumers can purchase, leading scores of outraged mothers to post a litany of complaints on the company's Facebook page. Bellamy's said it was working to produce more, and expected stock to replenish at the end of the month.  Chinese demand for foreign baby formula has led to shortages elsewhere as well, including the United Kingdom, where retailers have also curbed how much customers can buy.  Singles' Day in China started as a counter-holiday to Valentine's Day, encouraging singles to pamper themselves with some shopping. Now, it's morphed into a giant multi-billion dollar shopping bonanza each year, as more retailers and brands slash prices in efforts to attract shoppers. Consumers buy everything on the day from smartphones to shoes.  Bellamy's rose around 3% in Sydney trading on Wednesday.

{"text": "Google's latest version of Android will remind you to pick up your dry cleaning, it will turn on your dishwasher, and it will replace your credit card. The company announced the new operating system, codenamed \"Android M,\" on Thursday at its annual Google I/O developers conference in San Francisco.  It also announced a new app called Google Photos, which will give you unlimited online photo and video storage.  Android M   Android M focuses on subtle improvements to the user experience, including squashing a ton of bugs and overhauling basic features, according to Dave Burke, Google's VP of engineering.  The biggest news is Android Pay, Google's (GOOGL, Tech30) latest take on mobile payments. It's pretty similar to Apple (AAPL, Tech30) Pay, and a big improvement over Google Wallet, the companies earlier attempt at a mobile wallet. Just unlock your phone and tap on a reader -- no need to open an app.  Google has been working with major credit cards and U.S. mobile carriers on Android Pay. The open platform works with any other device with NFC and users can pay for goods at more than 700,000 stores across the United States.  Third-party apps can also use Android Pay inside their apps, so you can pay for your Lyft with Android Pay.  Other Android M improvements include a new permissions tool that give users more control over what data they share with apps. Prompts and a reorganized setting screen let them manage what apps can access things like location, camera, microphone, contacts and sensors.  Chrome Custom tabs will offer in-app browsing, sharing things like login information between apps and the browser. When you click on links in apps, they can now open directly inside apps instead of asking users to choose between a browser and an app.  In an attempt to get more battery life, Andoroid M will have a feature called Device Sync Activity. It tracks your activity to tell when you're not using your phone much and put the phone into a \"doze\" mode that uses less power.  Future phones will support multi-tasking USB Type C cords for charging and data transfer.  And Following in the footsteps of Apple, Google will now offer HBO Now on Google Play for Android and Chromecast users.  Google Photos   Google announced a new tool called Google Photos that lets you store all of your photos and videos in one place, for free. Available Thursday, it accepts an unlimited number of images up to 16 megapixels or videos up to 1080p. It's a way to gather all images in one place instead of spread out across devices, Dropbox and desktops.  It organizes photos by who's in them (using facial recognition), where they were taken and what's in them. That means if you have a kid, you can zoom through their life in photos. Or after a breakup you can relive the entire painful thing in chronological order while eating ice cream and sobbing. The app can also make collages and edit movies.  It seems similar to Apple Photos, but Google has actually always had really impressive photo features. Recently they've been locked away inside Google Plus or forgotten about in the Picasa desktop application. Now they are free.  Google Now  Google Now is Google's three-year-old predictive assistant tool that gives you information it thinks you'll want, before you ask for it.  A new feature called Now on Tap lets you access Google Now powers in the moment, wherever you are on the phone. Google on Tap is following along and picking up on context, in any app you're using on your smartphone.  Talking about a movie with your mom over email? Hold down the Home button and Now on Tap will pop up reviews and times. When you're in a music app listening to a song, you can use voice commands to ask a question about the band (\"What is his real name?\").  Text messages can be turned into calendar events, and improved natural-language processing does cool things like figure out mispronounced words based on context.  Like Android, but for the Internet of Things  Google also announced Brillo, an operating system for the Internet of Things. That's the much ballyhooed word of regular \"dumb\" objects and devices that are hopping online.  Based on Android, Brillo will be available to developers later this year. Brillio includes a language called Weave for all those objects to speak to each other, mobile devices and the cloud.  Right now IoT devices use a number of different communications protocols, which is problematic. Adding yet another language could unify them ... or just add more fragmentation.  Chasing the next billion  Google predicts the next billion people to get online for the first time will do it with a phone in 2016. That's a lot of potential customers, but one problem they'll face is slow internet connectivity. Google is optimizing its apps so that they work better over shoddy connections. Chrome has been optimized to load pages faster, stripping out unnecessary bulk from webpages.  Google is also focusing on making more content available offline, like Chrome pages, YouTube Videos and Google Maps. Offline Google Maps will be available for everyone, and include turn-by-turn directions, search and information about different places, all without an Internet connection. Because if you are really, truly lost, you very likely don't have one.

{"text": "When you can't control your financial life, make sure someone you trust will by assigning power of attorney when writing your will. No one is immune from aging or the loss of mental clarity that may come with it. And you're never immune to health crises that may leave you unable to handle the business of your life: paying bills, managing investments or making key financial decisions.  Granting someone you trust the power of attorney allows that person -- known as your \"agent\" or \"attorney in fact\" -- to manage your financial affairs if you are unable to do so.  Your agent is empowered to sign your name and is obligated to be your fiduciary -- meaning they must act in your best financial interest at all times and in accordance with your wishes.  There are different kinds of powers of attorney, but in estate planning there are two essential types you should know:  The first is the \"springing power of attorney,\" which only goes into effect under circumstances that you specify, the most typical being when you become incapacitated.  Often that means your agent cannot act until he or she provides doctors' letters and sometimes court orders to prove you are incapable of making decisions for yourself.  There is also the \"durable power of attorney.\" It is effective immediately, and your agent does not need to prove your incapacity in order to sign your name.  An attorney can help you decide which form makes the best sense for your circumstance. In any case, take care in choosing your agent. That person should be competent, trustworthy, willing to take on the burden of your affairs and financially secure.  If you choose a relative or friend as your agent, you probably won't have to pay them. But if you name a bank, lawyer or other outside party, you will have to negotiate compensation, which can range from hourly fees to a percentage of your assets paid annually.  If you do become incapacitated without having assigned power of attorney, the court will step in to appoint a guardian. This process might cost your family well over $1,000, not including the cost of the guardian's annual visits to court to report on your situation. Plus, the person chosen may not be someone you would have picked.

In October of last year, he told The Hill that the stock market is in a bubble. The stock market has gone up more than 6% since he made those comments.  \"The only reason the stock market is where it is, is because you get free money,\" Trump said.  Trump slammed America's central bank -- the Federal Reserve -- for keeping interest rates at extremely low levels. People can borrow money at cheap rates. Meanwhile, they earn almost nothing if they save money in the bank. This encourages people to take risks.

{"text": "Google is taking a uniquely Google-esque approach to increasing the diversity of its workforce. The Mountain View, Calif., tech giant is trying to get more women and minorities into technology with an ambitious, $150 million plan. Google told CNNMoney half that money will go to outside organizations and communities, while the other half will be used internally to make Google more inclusive.  In a blog post this week, VP of People Operations Nancy Lee laid out the company's strategy for 2015. It follows earlier public efforts by Google (GOOG) to increase diversity, including sending Google engineers to historically black universities and and working with Disney (DIS) to improve depictions of girls in computer science. In 2014, the company put $114 million toward diversity programs.  The company is also expanding where it looks for fresh talent by recruiting at a wider variety of colleges.  The lack of diversity in tech goes deeper than just the HR department. As was highlighted in the Ellen Pao gender discrimination trial, company culture is also key to keeping and encouraging a diverse workforce. Google is offering more internal training and workshops on unconscious bias, and employees can use part of their time to work on diversity initiatives.  It's also looking at the root of the problem, expanding computer science education for kids and pushing to get under-served communities online.  The company still has a lot of work to do. According to the diversity report it released last year, only 17% of its tech workers are female, 1% of its tech workforce is black and 2% are Hispanic. In the blog post, Lee said Google plans to release 2015 diversity numbers soon.  In March, Google executive Eric Schmidt was called out during a panel on diversity at SXSW for repeatedly interrupting Megan Smith, the chief technology officer of the U.S. and a former Googler. The audience member who pointed it out was Judith Williams, the manager of Google's global diversity and talent programs.  It's not the only company putting money into diversity.

{"text": "Puerto Rico is getting a lifeline from Washington D.C. On Thursday, President Obama signed a bill known as PROMESA (Spanish for \"promise\") to help Puerto Rico get out of its massive economic crisis.  The island has run up nearly $70 billion of debt (about $20,000 per resident). At the same time, the island's population has shrunk dramatically. Puerto Ricans are moving to Florida, Texas and elsewhere in the mainland U.S. for better paying jobs.  PROMESA was a bipartisan compromise with the Republican House and Senate. Both chambers approved the bill by a large margin.  \"There is still much work to be done. With legislation in place, Puerto Rico will now have time to work out an orderly financial path forward after July 1,\" Obama's Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said Wednesday night after the Senate approved PROMESA.  Related: Puerto Rico's crisis: How did it get so bad?  Puerto Rico still expected to default July 1  Puerto Rico is widely expected to miss most, if not all, of the $2 billion bond payment it owes creditors by July 1. The island says it doesn't have enough money to pay.  PROMESA won't provide any funding to pay the debt, but it does prevent bondholders from suing the island for a few months. It also installs a fiscal Oversight Board to come up with a plan to finally solve the crisis. That plan may ultimately include giving creditors a \"haircut\" where they receive less money back or get delayed payments.  \"We are in favor of PROMESA,\" says Jorge Irizarry. He's the head of Bonistas del Patio, a group representing the more than 60,000 Puerto Ricans who own some of the bonds that are in trouble. \"We need economic growth. That's the only thing that will get Puerto Rico back on its feet.\"  Why July 1 is so important  Puerto Rico has already defaulted three times, but the July 1 payment is different.  If Puerto Rico misses this one, it will be the first time since 1933 that a state or territory (Puerto Rico is a territory under U.S. law) fails to pay its general obligation bonds on time, says Cate Long, an expert on government bonds and head of the Puerto Rico Clearinghouse, a research firm.  General obligation bonds are the creme de la creme of the bond world. Payment is generally guaranteed.  \"In the Puerto Rican constitution it requires the general obligation bond payment to be made before any other expenditure of the government,\" says Long.

{"text": "Can taxing pimps, prostitutes and other underground economy dwellers really fix Social Security? Mike Huckabee thinks so.  Huckabee defended his support of the Fair Tax at the Republican debate on Thursday evening. Pushed by Americans For Fair Taxation, the tax reform proposal calls for replacing income and capital gains taxes, as well as payroll taxes, with a national sales tax.  Taxing people on what they buy, rather than on what they earn, would not only fund the federal government, it would shore up the shaky finances of the nation's largest entitlement programs, Huckabee asserts.  \"The Fair Tax transforms the process by which we fund Social Security and Medicare because the money paid in consumption is paid by everybody, including illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people that are freeloading off the system now,\" he said at the debate.  The idea is that tax evaders and those involved in the sex trade and other illegal activities who don't pay taxes on the income they earn. But under a Fair Tax, they'd have to pay taxes on the items they buy, just like everyone else. So that now-hidden income would be subject to tax.  Huckabee, however, is one of the few who thinks the Fair Tax is a viable alternative. The proposal would not only fail to fix Social Security's problems, it wouldn't bring in the same amount of revenue as the current income tax system, experts said.  \"The rate is just not enough to replace all the revenue they want to eliminate,\" said Alan Viard, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.  The tax comes with a host of problems. First of all, it's considered regressive, meaning it hits lower-income Americans harder than wealthy ones (even with a so-called prebate, which would make a certain level of spending tax-free in order to alleviate some of the burden on the poor).  Also, the rate would have to be pretty high. Americans for Fair Taxation say the rate would be 23%, but it means that out of a $1 purchase, 23 cents would be in taxes. In fact, most would consider it a 30% sales tax: 23 cents on top of the original 77-cent purchase, said Joe Rosenberg, senior research associate at Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan research group.  That high a rate would be difficult to enforce, even harder than the current income tax system, he said. Businesses would be tempted to under-report their sales and customers would push to pay in cash to avoid it.  The idea of a national retail sales tax was considered by President George W. Bush's tax reform panel in 2005, but was dismissed because it was too tough to administer and enforce, Rosenberg said.  Huckabee's spokespeople did not immediately return a request for comment.

His company is one of the insurers of Puerto Rico's debt that's made it clear it won't negotiate further until reviewing reliable numbers.  President Obama and Congress crafted a rescue bill for the island, a bipartisan compromise meant to create an orderly process to come to some sort of compromise between the island and the bondholders to work out a re-payment plan.  Related: There's a big sale on Puerto Rican homes  Obama signed the bill Thursday afternoon. Mere hours later, Governor Padilla issued an executive order saying the island would stop making general obligation bond payments, among other types of bond payments.  Defaults normally trigger lawsuits, but the bill Congress passed forbids bondholders from suing the island for several months. Instead, a fiscal Oversight Board will be appointed soon and tasked with coming up with a plan.  Update July 1 at 3pm to note that Puerto Rico released its audited financial statements for 2014 on Friday.

{"text": "Rand Paul wants to cut taxes. Like no one else before. He also wants to simplify the tax code, eliminate the estate and gift taxes and wipe out investment taxes too.  And he wants to do it by way of a \"flat tax.\"  \"As President, I would promote a Fair and Flat Tax plan, known as the 'EZ Tax.' My tax plan would be the largest tax cut in American history, reforming individual, business, and worker taxes,\" the Libertarian-leaning senator from Kentucky wrote on his new 2016 campaign Web site.  Related: Rand Paul: 'I am running for president'  The big idea behind a flat tax: Move from an income tax system with many rates to one single rate. Kill all but a few tax breaks. And make all investment income tax free. Generally, the goal is to only tax money once: either when it's earned or when it's withdrawn after being deposited or invested.  Not all flat-tax proposals are alike, however. They can differ in how high they set the rate; how big of an income tax exemption they allow for all filers based on family size; how many other tax breaks they include; and whether they eliminate payroll and estate taxes.  Related: Rand Paul-onomics: 4 things to know   Here are the few details we know about how Paul would structure his flat tax:  Single, flat tax rate: 17%  Paychecks: Individuals would pay 17% tax on wages and salaries. The net effective rate they pay would almost certainly be lower assuming they're allowed to take an exemption, which is typical under a flat tax. For example, say you gross $100 in income and get to exempt $20. You'd only pay 17% on the $80 that remains. That works out to be $13.60, or just 13.6% of your gross income.  Business income: Businesses would be subject to the same 17% rate.  Investment income: Capital gains, dividends and interest would be tax free.  Payroll tax: Low- and middle-income workers would get an exemption from the Social Security tax. How much isn't clear.  Estate and gift tax: Eliminated.  Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT): Eliminated.  It's not clear how Paul's campaign proposal for a flat tax differs from the flat-tax proposal he's made in the past two years.  Under that earlier proposal, Paul said he would preserve and increase both the personal exemption and standard deduction. He would also keep tax-free fringe benefits to employees, such as employer contributions to help pay for workers' health insurance. And all capital gains made on the sale of one's primary residence also would be tax-free.  Related: Why the middle class is still getting snared by the 'wealth tax'  A frequent criticism of the flat tax is that it may disproportionately benefit the very rich, since they have so much investment income, which would be tax-free. But given how few details there are about Paul's proposal, it's too early to say what the distributional effects would be.  What can be said is that his flat tax proposals would bring in far less revenue than the current system. Why? If he wanted to maintain the current amount of revenue, that would require a flat rate of at least 25%, said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate of the Tax Policy Center.  Paul's proposal outlined Tuesday would, by the candidate's own estimate, bring in $700 billion less revenue every year than the current income tax system.  At the same time, Paul stressed his disdain for the country's debt when announcing his bid for the presidency. \"Stop spending money you don't have,\" he said.  That goal will be much harder to reach under his flat tax plan.  A spokesman for Paul's campaign told CNNMoney full details on his plan will be released \"in the coming weeks.\" ", "date": "April 8, 2015: 10:01 AM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/07/pf/taxes/rand-paul-flat-tax/", "author": "Jeanne Sahadi"},
{"text": "Donald Trump is finally showing us more of his economic plan beyond the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan on his red hat. America has now learned:  -- He wants to tax the rich more and the middle class less.  -- He wants to lower corporate taxes.  -- He wants to cut government spending and stop raising the debt ceiling.  \"The hedge fund people make a lot of money and they pay very little tax,\" Trump said in an interview Wednesday with Bloomberg. \"I want to lower taxes for the middle class.\"  In short, Trump is willing to raise taxes on himself and those like him.  Many hedge fund managers and real estate investors are able to list their earnings as \"carried interest\" because of an IRS tax rule. They are able to cast their earnings as investment gains instead of income, which allows them to be taxed at a lower rate.  \"You've seen my statements. I do very well. I don't mind paying a little more in taxes. The middle class is getting clobbered in this country,\" he said.  Related: Donald Trump trounces GOP field  Eliminate \"inheritance\" tax or worry about inequality   Trump has been all over the place on taxes over the years. He criticized President Obama for not wanting to keep the Bush tax cuts in place on the wealthiest Americans. He has also proposed eliminating the so-called \"estate tax\" on people that inherit money, gifts and property from their parents. Both moves would be a major gain for the rich.  Now Trump is starting to sound more populist.  \"The middle class built this country, not the hedge fund guys,\" he said Wednesday.  \"One of the reasons he is winning votes is he's talking about the macro issues that so frustrate many Americans and seem so blatantly unfair,\" says Peter Morici, a professor of economics at University of Maryland's Robert Smith school of business.  Lower corporate taxes and bring $2.5 trillion home  Trump also wants to even the playing field on taxes that businesses pay. He believes that lowering the corporate tax rate will stop American companies from trying to move their headquarters -- and possibly jobs -- overseas in an effort to dodge taxes in the U.S.  Many U.S. companies such as Apple (AAPL, Tech30) have huge cash reserves that they could spend on growing their businesses, but that money is mostly held overseas to avoid U.S. taxes. Trump estimates as much as $2.5 trillion could return to America if taxes were lower.  \"This is money that could be spent in this country,\" he said. \"We have companies with thousands of jobs that are leaving this country.\"  Related: U.S. companies hoard record amounts of cash  Washington is full of \"scandalous\" waste  Trump was also asked about whether he would continue to raise America's debt ceiling.  The standoff between President Obama and Republicans in Congress over whether to raise the ceiling in 2011 caused U.S. debt to lose its AAA rating.  Republicans should fight Obama again over the issue, Trump argues, even if it causes pain in financial markets.  \"I think there's so much waste, so much scandalous waste in Washington that we shouldn't have to [raise the debt ceiling],\" he said.  Trump continues to lead the GOP field solidly. Rivals accuse him of not having real plans.  \"The big issues he talks about do make some sense,\" says Morici. \"The question is...is there really much substance there or is this just a few phrases?\" ", "date": "August 28, 2015: 4:09 AM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/27/news/economy/donald-trump-economy-tax-plan/index.html?iid=EL", "author": "Heather Long"},

Hedge fund billionaire Jim Chanos is a big fan of Joe Biden's. Chanos said Biden would \"make a great president.\"  \"The vice president is a good friend,\" Chanos told NPR's Roben Farzad in a recent interview. \"I have no idea if he's going to run or not, but if he does, I will support him.\"  Chanos founded an investment firm named Kynikos Associates. It's the Greek word for \"cynic.\" He is famous on Wall Street for predicting the fall of Enron, and his hedge fund makes money betting that certain company stocks will fall in value, a practice known as short-selling.  But Chanos is bullish on Biden. He says Biden has a track record of working with people across the aisle and that he has broad appeal.  Related: Inside Donald Trump's bankruptcy track record  \"I think he actually hits a chord with the middle class that a lot of the other candidates might not hit,\" Chanos told NPR.

Related: Can the global gloom sink the U.S. economy?   The one major boomerang could be China. Chanos has been warning that the economic problems there could turn out to be the next Greece. He's especially worried about the large amount of debt building up in China.  Lately, developments in China seem to be validating some of his fears. One of the main economic concerns at the moment is whether China's slowdown will hurt the rest of the world, including the Untied Sates.  \"The [Chinese] real estate market is a lot more important than the stock market,\" Chanos says. Chinese stocks have fallen dramatically in recent weeks, and that has caused investors in the U.S. to sell at record levels as well. August is set to be the worst month for U.S. stocks, for both the Dow & the S&P 500, in several years.  But overall, Chanos says the U.S. economy is in strong shape and is likely to pull through.

{"text": "It was less than four months ago that China was sneezing and the rest of the world was catching a cold. Turmoil in Chinese equities and currency markets in early January spooked investors worldwide. The fear was that policymakers in Beijing were losing control of a slowdown in China's giant economy, bringing risks to the rest of the globe.  Fast forward to the first-quarter GDP data released Friday, and the news was met with barely a ripple of reaction in the markets. The numbers confirmed that China's economy has not fallen off a cliff. In fact, it's stabilizing.  That's the good news. The bad news is that all the tools that China is using now to underpin economic growth are from a playbook that's all too familiar.  \"This looks like an old-style, credit-backed, investment-driven recovery,\" SG Global Economics said in a research note. It noted that the current situation \"bears an uncanny resemblance\" to the beginning of China's debt-driven stimulus package during the depths of the global financial crisis.  In other words, one step forward two steps back.  Related: China posts slowest quarterly growth in 7 years  Beijing has clearly avoided the economic hard landing that investors were worrying about in January. But rather than address its economy's deep-rooted issues through reforms and restructuring, it's reverted to its old approach of throwing money at the problem.  Take a look at the numbers. In the first quarter, infrastructure spending boomed and credit growth soared.  In March alone, Chinese financial institutions made loans totaling $211 billion, twice as much as the previous month and well ahead of expectations.   That all adds up to a big financial shot in the arm for the economy, with echoes of China's $600 billion spending spree in 2009 to protect the economy from the downdrafts of the financial crisis emanating from the U.S.  The 2009 effort worked, but not for the long term. The stimulus package left big asset bubbles created by easy money and speculation.  The same could be happening again. Property prices are soaring in major Chinese cities once again. According to property services group Cushman and Wakefield, prices in Shanghai are up a whopping 24% in just the first two months of the year.  Bad loans are piling up at the big state-controlled banks, and officials are warning about high levels of corporate debt.  Related: Bad loans on the rise at China's biggest banks  For how long will Beijing's new round of efforts succeed in propping up the economy?  In a note to clients, Goldman Sachs says it doubts the \"sustainability of the acceleration beyond the next few months\". According to Goldman, there is a \"high likelihood\" that Chinese economic growth will hit the lower end of the government's 6.5%-7% target range this year.  SG Global Economics also says the current recovery \"will not last very long\".  What's missing in Beijing's response to the slowing economy is the commitment to economic reforms that will have a long-term effect of rebalancing the economy.  That means moves like killing off the zombie state-owned enterprises that are kept alive by government handouts while turning out products that nobody wants.  This type of restructuring is painful and will cost millions of jobs if it's done properly.  But at this stage it appears Beijing does not have the political will to carry them through, preferring instead the old-style pump-priming that provides short-term relief but is not sustainable.

{"text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook has unveiled two new iPhones as well as the new Apple TV, iPad Pro and Apple Watches. The new iGadgets were unveiled during a press event Wednesday at San Francisco's Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.  iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus  \"While they may look familiar, we have changed everything about these new iPhones,\" said Tim Cook.  Apple has updated its two smartphones. The new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are available in four colors: silver, gold, space gray and rose gold. The devices are now made from 7000 series aluminum, which is an aircraft-grade material. It's stronger than the previous phone aluminum and is unlikely to bend.  The devices' biggest addition is a 3D touch screen, a feature introduced on Apple trackpads and the Apple Watch, that was previously known as Force Touch. The technology recognizes new gestures like pressing and holding. It vibrates slightly to let you know it's been pressed.  The new iPhones also come with a 12 megapixel iSight rear camera, with 50% more pixels than the iPhone 6. The front-facing camera is now 5 megapixels (for sharper selfies).  A kooky new photography feature called \"Live Photos\" combines photos and videos. When you take a photo with the Live Photo setting on, it records a second-and-a-half video before and after the clip to make a tiny little video. Press and hold on your photo and it will play.  The phones also have the new A9 processor and faster fingerprint sensors. There are new charging docks to match the colors of the iPhones as well as new covers.  The phones will cost the same as the last version (starting at $650 and $750 for the 6S Plus). The previous versions (iPhone 6 and 6 Plus) will each drop $100.  A new iPhone Upgrade program lets you lease an iPhone for $32 a month and get a new version every year.  The new iPhones will go on pre-sale on September 12 and will hit stores on September 25. IOS 9 will be available on September 16 for anyone with an iPhone as old as an iPhone 4S.  iPad Pro   As expected, Apple is making a bigger, faster iPad. The iPad Pro is 12.9 inches. It's the same height as the iPad Air, so you can run iPad Air apps side by side. The screen has 5.6 million pixels -- more than a 15-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display.  The iPad Pro starts at $799.  Inside it's much faster. The iPad Pro has a new A9X 64-bit chip. It's 1.8 times faster than the previous iPad's CPU (\"desktop class\" according to Apple executive Phil Schiller). It is powerful enough to edit three streams of 4K video at a time. It has a 10-hour battery life, is super thin and weighs just over 1.5 pounds.  \"Why make an iPad with a bigger display?\" asked Schiller. Good question!  Games and movies look better on a bigger screen, he said. It's big enough to have a full-size keyboard on the screen. If you don't want to type on the screen, Apple has made a new smart keyboard that doubles as a cover, Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) Surface-style. The keyboard is coated with a thin fabric.  The company is also making its own stylus, but with the usual over-the-top design and marketing. Yes, it's the Apple Pencil, a low latency stylus that feels like a real pencil. It even got its own Jony Ive narrated videos. It \"feels like a true writing or drawing instrument,\" said Ive.  As the name implies, the iPad Pro's real target audience is business users. To show that it's serious, Apple brought out a very unexpected partner to demo the iPad Pro: Microsoft's Kirk Konenigsbauer. He demonstrated Microsoft Office for iPad Pro using the Apple Pencil.   Adobe (ADBE) also demoed its iPad Pro apps including a new product called Photoshop Fix, a retouching tool. Using the iPad Pro and new stylus, Adobe's Eric Snowden did some realtime edits including the odd choice of changing a photo of a model to make her smile more. (It was the first woman on stage during the presentation.)  For the final demo, Irene Walsh from 3D4Medical showed off her startup's 3D medical app that shows 3D interactive anatomy images for medical students and patients.  The company also announced a new iPad Mini 4.  Apple TV  \"We believe the future of television is apps,\" said Tim Cook before introducing the expected new Apple TV.  The latest Apple TV features a third-party App Store, a new remote, Siri controls and a completely overhauled operating system. The TV now runs on tvOS, which is based on iOS and \"built for the living room,\" according to Apple's Eddie Cue.  The device will start shipping in October and cost $149 for the 32 GB version and $199 for 64 GB.  The new black remote features a glass touch surface on the top half, so you can navigate the Apple TV with swipes and other gestures. The Bluetooth remote has volume controls for the TV and a built-in accelerometer and gyroscope. It can last three months on one charge. It recharges using a Lightning connector.  Too lazy to swipe? Tell Siri what you want, like, \"Siri, show me a New Girl episode with Jamie Lee Curtis in it.\" If you miss something, say, \"Siri, what did she say?\" and the episode will rewind a few seconds and turn on captions. Don't know what you want to watch, Siri can make movie and TV suggestions based on things like genre.  Siri searches across all apps, so you don't have to jump between HBO Go and Netflix to find something specific.  The biggest boost for the device is opening it up to third-party developers. You can use the device to play multiplayer games. Apple demoed a few examples, including Harmonix's Beat Sports and Hipster Whale's Crossy Road. Another app by Gilt lets you shop directly from the Apple TV. MLB has an Apple TV app for watching multiple live games at a time with pop-up notifications and interactive stats.  Apple Watch  The company kicked off the event with an update about the Apple Watch.  Fashionistas now have more band options. The biggest addition is a wrap-around brown leather Herm\u00e9s band, which will be available in October. The watch itself now comes in gold and rose gold, and there are new sports band options as well.  The smart device was released in April. There are now more than 10,000 watch apps, including a few new important additions. Facebook Messenger's app will let you send text, audio and location messages. GoPro's app acts as a viewfinder for your camera. iTranslate lets you speak a word and get a translation and AirStrip is a tool for medical professionals. It's also adding transit directions to the included Maps app.  Related: The iPhone through the years  ", "date": "September 10, 2015: 8:45 AM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/09/technology/apple-iphone-6s-announcement/", "author": "Heather Kelly"},
{"text": "While Apple is busy promoting the newest iteration of its Apple TV box, many followers of the company are peering into the future, wondering what the technology giant will do next with television. In a recent interview I quizzed Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue about this and read between the lines of his answers.  First I brought up the cable TV status quo. Right now \"cable\" as we know it consists of three parts: a bundle of channels, a set top box that delivers those channels to your TV screen, and an often-derided customer service experience.  These parts are sold together, but companies like Apple, Google and Roku are starting to break them apart. Compared with the clunkiness of the set top box, Cue calls Apple TV is a \"much better experience for consuming content.\"  For most people, he said, Apple TV is an add-on to cable, since people still need a cable subscription to use apps like ESPN and CNN.  But more and more programming is available outside the cable bundle, like HBO, which now offers standalone subscriptions via the Internet.  The end goal for Apple, Cue said, is to remove any need for a traditional set top box at all.  Maybe the next step is a streaming version of the bundle, with live and on-demand channels, sold by Apple straight to Apple TV and iPhone owners.  \"Apple is having conversations with everyone about doing their own streaming services,\" CBS CEO Les Moonves said last month.   The idea isn't far-fetched. Apple already sells a monthly music subscription. But the negotiations with the TV networks have been arduous.  Related: Moonves says CBS will 'probably' be part of Apple's TV service  When I brought up Moonves's comments to Cue, he responded coyly. \"The great thing is that Les is actually on Apple TV,\" he said.  He meant CBS's new streaming option, called All Access, which lets people watch on-demand episodes of CBS shows for $6 a month.  But what about buying a whole cable package, including CBS, right through the TV?  \"If Comcast or any other provider wants to do that, they'll be able to do that with the current Apple TV,\" Cue said.  When I asked directly if Apple wants to get to the point that Moonves has been describing, an Apple-branded TV package, Cue said, \"We want to get to the point where customers are able to buy whatever they want, however they want. We're not fixed into 'There's only one way to buy it.' Just like we've done with the App Store, where there have been things that have been free; things that you subscribe to; things that you pay for; things that are in-app. All of those capabilities will be here and we want that market to be able to develop.\"  An Apple TV version of the App Store is one of the main features of the new $150 box. Cue's pitch is that the App Store is enabling different forms of TV to flourish by giving creators and developers a \"platform to truly innovate.\"  But what will Apple do itself? There's a lot that Apple could do to disrupt TV. It could offer online storage of TV shows, for example, doing away with the need for a DVR.  When I asked Cue about the pain of authentication \u2014 having to log in to all these individual channel apps with my cable credentials \u2014 he said \"those are things that we can always make better.\"  He pointed out that people can already subscribe to Netflix and Hulu right through the Apple TV. \"So we're already doing that,\" he said, \"and we'll do more of it.\" (Read between the lines as you will.)  I also asked Cue if he felt that Apple TV needs exclusive programming to differentiate from competing devices like Google Chromecast and Roku.  \"We don't try to do things that are exclusive,\" he answered. \"What we try to do is build technologies that let developers do things that they can't do anywhere else.\"  A WME/IMG web video channel about fashion is exclusive to Apple TV for three months this fall, but Cue said the exclusivity was their choice, not Apple's.  Related: Apple's next pursuit: Its own original programming?Regarding the recent news reports  Regarding the recent news reports that Apple is thinking about financing TV shows itself \u2014 a la ABC and Netflix \u2014 Cue was evasive.  \"We love working with our partners,\" he said. \"We're great at technology and they're great at creating content, and we think that's a great partnership to have.\"  So there's not a reason for Apple to create its own signature TV show like \"House of Cards?\" The company recently established a 24/7 streaming radio channel, after all.  Cue responded this way: \"I think there's a tremendous amount of great content out there today, and we want to make it easier for customers to have access to it.\"  There may be no better corporate secret-keeper in the world than Apple.

The move immediately prompted debates of all sorts. Among travelers, the chatter centered around what's an appropriate amount and who else to tip along the way.  Marriott (MAR) didn't specify, but the American Hotel & Lodging Association suggests leaving housekeepers a tip of $1 to $5 per day. There was no guide for tipping others who help in your travels - the bellhop, the valet or the cab driver.  Related: Mariott: Tip your housekeeper!  Etiquette pros agree that tipping can be awkward, especially in unfamiliar environments.  The number one rule of thumb: When in doubt, tip. But remember to ask if tips are accepted, since there are some establishments that have a \"no tipping\" policy.  \"Let me tell you, they will tell you if they accept tips,\" said Jacqueline Whitmore, founder of The Protocol School in Palm Beach.  But you don't want to blow you entire vacation budget by overtipping, so here's a cheat sheet:  At the airport  Taxi Driver: 10-15% of the bill and add $2-$3 for every bag the driver helps get in and out of the vehicle.  Private Car Service: 20% of the total, but be sure to check the bill to see if the tip is already included, especially if the car is pre-paid. \"If someone else is paying for it, add a tip,\" said etiquette expert Elaine Swann. \"Go with a dollar amount based on distance: $5 for shorter trips and $10 or more for longer distances.\"  Related: Hottest places to travel this winter  Shuttle Drivers: $1-$3 per bag if the driver assists with loading and unloading. If the driver doesn't help, the experts said it's acceptable to skip a tip.  Wheelchair assistance/Skycap: $5-$10 for assistance getting through security and to the gate or for plane-side pickup. For skycaps, tip $1-$2 per bag.  At the hotel  Any person that helps with your bags should get tipped $1-$3 per bag, including doormen, bellman and greeters. If a doorman hails a cab, tip $1-$2, said Whitmore.  Housekeeping: $2-$10 a day depending on the quality of service and the hotel. Because staff can vary each day, experts advise leaving a tip daily. If a staff member brings up extra towels late at night or fulfills another request, tip $1-$5. \"If someone is coming to your floor that wouldn't ordinarily be there, give a tip,\" said Whitmore.  Related: Best hotels of 2014  Room Service: 10-15% of the bill if it's not already included. \"If it is, you can give $1-$5 to the delivery person,\" suggested Patricia Napier-Fitzpatrick, founder of the Etiquette School of New York.  Concierge: $10 or more depending on the level of engagement. Scoring hard-to-get reservations or tickets should be rewarded with more, said Napier-Fitzpatrick. There's no need to tip for dining or activity recommendations.  Out & about   Tour Guides: $5-$10 for a group tour, or 20% of the cost for a private guide. \"If it's a bus tour, don't forget to also tip the bus driver a couple bucks,\" said Napier-Fitzpatrick.  Wine Sommelier: Optional. But if service is exceptional, Whitmore recommended a tip of 5-10% of the wine.  Valet: $2-$5 each time an attendant brings the car.

{"text": "Apple's new iPhones, that giant iPad Pad Pro, and the completely overhauled Apple TV aren't available until later this year, but I was able to get my fingerprints all over the shiny new goods. Here's a peek (and a pop!) at what's coming.  iPad Pro  On paper, a 12.9-inch iPad sounds like a slam dunk. Who doesn't like bigger and better screens? But when you first see the iPad Pro next to a human, it is startlingly huge.  Apple (AAPL, Tech30) employees made it look easy to hold one in the palm of one hand while swiping with the other. One described it like holding a magazine. I managed not to drop one and shatter the screen.  It's light enough, just 1.57 lbs, but the slick Apple hardware design means there's no traction on the iPad Pro, nothing to hold on to but smooth metal. I think it's too unwieldy to use a naked iPad Pro suspended in the air like that, unless you have very large non-slip hands or work on the ISS.  It's not just gravity. As the name implies, the iPad Pro is designed for productivity. If you're working on two iPad apps side-by-side (a very neat feature) you'll want to have both hands free.  For creatives using the Pro as a designing or drawing surface, it makes sense to just plop down it on a table. But I imagine it will work best safely ensconced in cases with traction or handles, or mounted in special stands. Or, more likely, propped up with a keyboard in front of it (Apple's making its own attachable \"Smart Keyboard\" cover, just like the Microsoft Surface).   Apple Pencil  The Apple Pencil is classic Apple marketing. They took an existing product, the stylus, dipped it in the special Apple design sauce, and gave it a $99 price tag.  I used it to doodle and practice my cursive. It didn't have as much pressure range as I was expecting but there was no delay that I noticed. You can rest your palm on the iPad while using the stylus. The iPad will detect that it's your hand and ignore it. The coolest feature was an on screen ruler that you control with your other hand while making a straight line.  The pencil plugs in (awkwardly, but I guess it's nice not to need a cord) to the iPad Pro's lightening port for charging. The pencil was a bit slick to hold, and the tiny cap seems destined to get lost. There's no place on the iPad to stick the stylus, and it appears there isn't any storage option on the official Apple silicon case either.  The device is optimized to work on the iPad Pro and is not compatible with other iPads at this time.   Apple TV  The remote is the Apple TV's big centerpiece. Skinny and lightweight, it's part remote and part game controller. It has a built in accelerometer and gyroscope, for Wii-like powers. It has four buttons and volume controls below a touch surface.  I turned it on its side to drive a car and swiped left to right to browse through photos of houses for sale on the Zillow app. Press the dedicated Siri button and a limited version of the voice-assistant will help find and control content. Siri only works with iTunes, Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Showtime apps at the moment, and doesn't appear to have some of the typical Siri features in the iPhone like Googling facts.  One big disappointment is that while Siri gets a dedicated button on the remote, there's no \"Hey Siri\" powers in the Apple TV. Hey Siri is the hands-free version of Siri on the iPhone. If the Apple TV could be triggered with the key phrase, it could easily stomp out Amazon's Echo.  Other fun details: Apple TV apps will be able to work with the Apple Watch, multiplayer games can be played with anyone on an iOS device, and it works with third party MFi controllers, including a Garage Band guitar.   iPhones with 3D Touch  Apple has come up with some adorable terms to describe the new pressure-sensitive touchscreen features on the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus. When you press the 3D Touch screen, you get a \"peek\" at what's going on in an app or email. For example, press down on the Facebook (FB, Tech30) app icon and a little window will give you options to search, check-in, take a photo or update your status. Press on a user in Instagram and get a \"peek\" of their other photos.  Press harder and you \"pop,\" which is code for actually selecting something. The screen doesn't actually press down or click, but a vibrating haptic engine gives you a little jiggle so you know it worked. I had to press down harder than I though to get either feature to work, and am not sure they address any great needs I have, but the interface looks great.

{"text": "It starts with an awkward moment. A business transaction happens, and it's hard to know what to do next -- is a thank you enough? A handshake? Or is it a good time to slip somebody a few bills?  It depends on the service provided. While a waiter might be obvious, not all situations are as clear-cut.  \"The reason why we tip is to show respect to the service provider,\" said Diane Gottsman, an etiquette expert. \"Part of our responsibility is to be a respectful community member and give to those who deserve a tip, without going overboard.\"  She suggested that a good rule of thumb is \"when in doubt, do.\"  Here are a few people who may not first come to mind when considering gratuity.  1. The exterminator  There are generally two types of exterminators: those who do monthly maintenance visits, and those who treat a specific infestation. Exterminators in the latter category are usually tipped, said Timothy Wong, the director of M&M Pest Control in New York City.  On average, 20%-25% of customers tip, Wong said, in an amount ranging from $10-$20. \"There are exceptions. Some will tip $40-$50,\" he said. Some clients give up to $100 if it's a big job, like sealing a building against vermin, which can take up to three days to complete.  Wong said there's a clear tipping correlation between those who don't have infestations, and those who do. Those with happier results are more inclined to tip.  \"They will hug you, tip you, feed you, you name it,\" he said.  2. The cable guy  The worker who comes to your home to install your cable may work for the cable company directly, or might be an outside contractor. A tip for good service is often appreciated.  \"If he's out there in the hot sun, maybe digging around under your house, you want to show him a gesture of kindness,\" said Gottsman.  Some large providers -- like Comcast -- have policies in place that prohibit workers from accepting tips.  But that doesn't mean they won't. It doesn't necessarily have to be a cash tip, Gottsman said. It could be a cold glass of water or lunch, especially if the job takes several hours.  Wyatt Carpenter, a technician in Canton, Ohio, said people tip him, especially on extreme weather days. This past winter, he said he worked in temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees.  \"It's not life-changing money,\" he said of his tips. \"Five, 10, 20 bucks....\"  Another cable technician, Christopher McBriar, said while he doesn't expect a tip, it's nice to get $10, which he will use for lunch that day.  A nonmonetary tip he appreciates: When a customer is prepared for his visit. \"They have moved the furniture away from the wall or unpacked the TV from the box ... that goes a long way too,\" he said.  Related: 10 big overtime pay violators   3. The spray tanner  Adding on gratuity for a hair stylist is fairly typical, but tipping for beauty services doesn't end there.  \"Makeup and tanning is so overlooked,\" said Suzie Basset, a full-service salon owner in San Antonio, Tex. \"That's part of the grey area because [customers] just don't know.\" She said clients will occasionally ask her if a gratuity is expected.  \"It's uncomfortable for you, the payer, and it's uncomfortable for me, the receiver, on how to handle that,\" she said.  A safe bet is to tip salon service providers anywhere between 15%-20%. It is sometimes assumed that if the service provider is the salon owner a tip does not have to be included. Basset said that's changing, and many owners now welcome gratuities.  4. The dry cleaner  The person behind the counter of your local dry cleaner may not be the same person actually doing the work of removing the stain from your shirt, but a small token of gratitude wouldn't go amiss.  \"If someone got a stain out of my favorite white dress, I would ask them, 'Can I leave a tip? What would be a great way to say thank you?'\" said Lizzie Post, the co-author of Emily Post's Etiquette, 18th Edition.  It doesn't have to be cash. The Yelp Gratuitous Guide to Tipping suggests some flowers or a bottle of wine. That may sound romantic, but, \"if they remove a wine stain from your favorite Marc Jacobs dress,\" it might be worth it.  5. The road service employee  Maybe it's a flat on a busy highway far from home, or a dead car battery on a stormy night. A panicked moment, made manageable by the tow truck guy who came to the rescue.  \"Yes, he's working, that's his job, he is getting paid a salary... but maybe he's on a busy highway, or came in the rain in the middle of the night,\" said Gottsman. \"You can offer it.\" ", "date": "April 16, 2014: 7:05 AM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/04/16/pf/tipping-workers/index.html", "author": "Jillian Eugenios"},

{"text": "Not all waters are created equal. Connoisseurs are taking the language of wine and bringing it to the humble water glass, hoping to elevate the conversation around the stuff most of us drink every day.  There's more to it, these experts say, than just sipping something that comes out of the tap, or from one of the mass-produced bottled waters on the market. And when it comes to matching food with a refreshing beverage, there's sometimes nothing better than a glass of perfectly paired H20.  \"The chef cares about the food, the sommelier cares about the wine, but it seems like nobody cares about the water,\" said Michael Mascha, a food anthropologist who wrote a book detailing the tastes and profiles of bottled water around the world. \"You have 200 wines on your wine list, and you tell me still or sparkling?\"  For some who say water tastings and pairings are just another elitist practice of the 1%, Mascha disagrees. He says Americans are becoming more sophisticated with their dining, and it should be expected that water gets the same attention at the table.  \"People want to engage with something over dinner and just having a boring bottle of Pellegrino on the table doesn't cut it anymore,\" Mascha said.  Related: Would you order this $78 taco?  At Ray's & Stark Bar, a restaurant in Los Angeles, diners can experience a water tasting or order bottles from a 42-page water menu.  \"Water is not just water,\" said Martin Riese, the restaurant's water sommelier. Customers seem to be into the idea -- since introducing the water menu last year, water sales at the restaurant have increased 500%. And Riese's water label -- Beverly Hills 90H20 -- won the World's Best Water Award this year.  Riese suggests pairing water with food according to acidity and salinization. Like wine, water experts use words like minerality, balance and mouthfeel to describe a taste and use flavor profiles to match food.  Voss, for example, which is sold in a bottle that was designed by an artist for Calvin Klein, has slightly bitter notes. It will pair nicely with asparagus.  Related: Why this whisky costs $38,000 a bottle  Denmark makes a water called Iskilde. It is from a spring that was discovered 15 years ago by a retired insurance broker and his wife. Experts think water from that spring might be so old it could be from the last ice age. It costs about $12 for a liter.  According to Riese, Iskilde has both sweet and earthy notes making it a solid companion for pasta, mushroom dishes or pizza with truffles.  For delicate food, like sushi, it's best to go with something smooth and subtle, like still water with low minerality. The water Lauquen from Patagonia would work for even the most discerning palate, and that brand is specifically for the luxury market, selling at $24 a liter.  For dessert, a Spanish water called Vichy Catalan, which is very salty and bitter, can add a surprising dimension to chocolate dishes.  \"Very suddenly you have sweet and salty notes on your palate and that's very interesting,\" Riese said.

{"text": "Jordan Kivelstadt decided to ditch glass wine bottles after he literally kicked a keg. Kivelstadt was working on a bottling line in California and one day in 2008, things didn't go well. Bottling is a precise process, one wrong move and production can come to a shattering halt.  \"I had a bad bottling day and I sulked back into the winery and kicked the keg we stored some of the wine in. Then I realized: why can't I sell wine in this?\"  So he did. And he's not the only one getting innovative: Glass bottles are facing increased competition on wine shelves.  Kivelstadt launched Free Flow Wines in 2009 as a wine-in-a-keg producer and the company has since begun working with more than 200 brands to put their products in kegs to distribute to restaurants. He said there are more than 80,000 of his kegs floating around the country and that the majority of the wines sell for $8-$15 a glass, with a couple climbing to $20.  The argument for keeping wine in a glass bottle is that it helps a wine age properly. However, according to Kevin Zraly, founder of the Windows on the World Wine School, 90% of wine is meant to be consumed within one year. \"That means any of those can be put out in vessels outside the glass bottle and still be good wine.\"  Many of the bottle replacements are more cost effective because they reduce shipping and operational costs for winemakers.  But these alternatives aren't your grandmother's boxed wine. \"It's quality...it's not that sweet, sickly, manufactured wine that we saw our grandparents drink,\" said Gwendolyn Osborn, director of education at Wine.com. \"You can find quality red blends that aren't going to give you a headache within five minutes.\"  \"The structural presentation of wine is changing, that's for sure,\" said Andrew Streeter, a specialist in consumer packaging. He pointed to aluminum cans, pouches, paper bottles, plastic bag-lined boxes and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles as leading contenders for disrupting wine packaging.  Streeter expects wine to become so portable in 10 years that it will be \"much more like [carrying] a stick of gum.\"  Bandit wines, which come in Tetra Pak cartons made mainly from paper and come in 1 liter and 500mL sizes, have been around since 2004 and according to Bob Torkelson, president of Trinchero Family Estates, the brand sells a quarter of a million cases per year.  The Union Wine Co. in Oregon offers 375-mL cans with pinot noir and pinot gris. It's the same wine packaged into the company's bottles, and the suggested retail price is $6 a can or $24 for a four pack. There are around two glasses of wine per can, and the company asks that you \"keep your pinkie down\" when drinking it.  Demand for more eco-friendly options has also spurred new bottles to hit wine shelves.  Sonoma County-Calif. based Truett-Hurst launched Paperboy and California Square last year. Paperboy's bottle is made from recycled cardboard with a plastic liner and is 85% lighter than a glass bottle, according to its winemaker Virginia Lambirx. It retails for around $12-$14 a bottle. Despite being described as \"good- quality wine\" by Lambirx she said, \"it's not going to appeal to the super wine snobs [because] it doesn't have a cork closure or come in a glass bottle.\"  Knowing this, the company also introduced California Square, which has the shape of a typical olive oil bottle. It's still made out of glass, but Lambirx said the square shape uses less material to store and ship. The line features a Russian River Valley Chardonnay, Paso Robles Three Red Blend and Paso Robles Cabernet.  When it comes to innovation, Kivelstadt said the wine industry is its own worst enemy. After all, it took nearly 10 years for the industry to accept a screw top.  But Zraly said consumers also have to play a role to embracing innovation. \"It's time to take wine off its pedestal; that wine is sacred liquid that can only be consumed by few and involve a big production.\" ", "date": "September 30, 2014: 8:00 AM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/30/pf/wine-packaging-alternatives-bottles/index.html", "author": "Kathryn Vasel"},
{"text": "The Supreme Court is toiling over a decision on two landmark cases involving same-sex couples. But many companies have already decided to support them. Last week, Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz publicly told off an investor who complained that the coffee giant's support of same-sex couples was hurting profits.  \"It's a free country ... you could sell your shares at Starbucks,\" Schultz said.  Schultz is not alone. In recent years, a wave of businesses have demonstrated their support for same-sex couples, sometimes drawing the ire of customers and investors.  J.C. Penney (JCP) featured a family with two moms in its Mother's Day advertisements last year and two dads for Father's Day. The ads received immediate backlash from the family advocacy group One Million Moms, which called on its members to boycott the store and send back its catalogs. The retailer didn't back down.  Related: Marriage ruling could save same-sex couples thousands  Also last summer, Target (TGT) sold a line of gay pride-themed T-shirts and donated $120,000 of proceeds to the Family Equality Council, an advocacy group for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.  Last June, Oreo posted a photo of a cookie with rainbow colored filling -- a symbol for the gay rights movement. The popular creme sandwich cookie made by Mondelez International (MDLZ) paired the photo with the captions \"pride\" and \"proudly support love.\"  And last month, more than 100 of the nation's largest companies filed a brief with the Supreme Court opposing Proposition 8, which prohibits same-sex marriage in California. This week, the country's highest court heard two cases: Defense Of Marriage Act, which denies federal benefits and recognition to married gay couples, and Proposition 8.  Companies including Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Google (GOOG), Morgan Stanley (MS), Nike (NKE), Verizon (VZ), Levi Strauss & Co. and American International Group (AIG) signed the brief and called rights for LGBT couples \"a business imperative.\"  The brief says laws such as Prop 8 could force gay workers out of states that don't recognize same-sex marriage, interfering with companies' ability to hire and compete.  \"Laws that prohibit marriage by two people of the same sex discriminate against ... millions of employees, as well as their customers, clients and vendors,\" the companies wrote.  Businesses don't have much to lose by sticking up for gay rights. Already, 53% of Americans support same-sex marriage, a sentiment that's even higher among the coveted under-30 consumer.  It also makes business sense. Same-sex couples have been shown to out-earn and outspend opposite sex couples.  According to a 2012 study from Experian Marketing Services, the typical household income for a married or partnered lesbian woman is $7,200 higher than that of a married or partnered heterosexual woman, and $21,500 more for a gay man.  Same-sex couples spend more on their weddings, too, despite having fewer guests, according to survey conducted by TheKnot.com.  \"Corporate support for the LGBT community largely preceded public support for it,\" said Gary Gates, a demographer at the Williams Institute, which studies legal issues that affect the LGBT population at the University of California at Los Angeles Law School. \"Corporate America perceived that there was a big consumer market.\" ", "date": "April 1, 2013: 11:14 AM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/29/news/companies/same-sex-marriage-companies/index.html", "author": "Emily Jane Fox"},

Formerly a vice president at Google (GOOG), Smith joined the Obama administration last fall as the Chief Technology Officer of the United States.  On Friday, in jeans and a blazer -- a look she lauded as \"sort of tech and sort of White House!\" -- she held the first White House Tech Meetup, a high-profile event for Meetup, a company that counts more than 10,000 tech Meetups around the country.  The gathering was the administration's latest effort to promote the 500,000 unfilled information technology jobs.  Last month, President Obama launched TechHire, an initiative to help train under-served populations for these roles.  Related: 9 reasons to be hopeful about women in tech  At the White House Friday, there were more than 50 representatives from around the country: Meetup leaders, city representatives, community organizers. Even the mayor of South Orange, New Jersey, was there.  \"All of you share a passion for getting things done,\" said Smith.  But tech wasn't the sole unifying passion in the discussion. Instead, it was a drive for inclusion: of women and minorities, of poor children and rural areas, of those from states like Nebraska and Alaska. It was also the belief that tech is vital to improving lives -- especially in communities that are underrepresented in the broader culture and business worlds.  Related: I told a dude how much I made. It changed my life.  \"You are creating opportunity,\" Meetup CEO and Cofounder Scott Heiferman repeated emphatically.

The couple started Code Crew to teach themselves to code when they were laid off -- and then grew it into a 7,000-member organization in two years.  The power of technology was echoed by many, but there was a caveat.  \"If we're not careful, technology reinforces existing structures of inequality,\" said Demond Drummer, who is working to counter that in South Chicago. \"Just like the literacy tests [in the '60s], technology is a wall that people are facing today.\"  Related: Lesbians in tech are gaining ground  So the question remains: How do you make sure technology opens doors and isn't a barrier?

Those abysmal statistics make it even more important to reach kids at a young age and introduce them to tech -- and all the possibilities it opens up. The sentiment was echoed repeatedly Friday: It's the responsibility of tech and community leaders to increase outreach.  \"None of us were born techies,\" said Aliya Rahman, who recently left Code for Progress. \"Some of the best techies out there may not get here unless we say, 'You are important, we need you.'\"  ", "date": "April 17, 2015: 5:59 PM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/17/technology/white-house-tech-meetup-megan-smith/", "author": "Aimee Rawlins"},
{"text": "Rebecca Juro, 50, has been unemployed for the last four years and she can't help but think it's because she's transgender. She has applied for almost 100 jobs and has gone on close to 20 interviews, but there have been no offers. No one says they aren't hiring her because she's transgender. But some employers tell her the job has been filled even though she continues to see postings for it online. Others have \"laughed in my face.\"  \"With as many non-trans people out of work as there are, it seems almost no one is going to hire a trans woman when there's another choice,\" said Juro, who lives at home with her mom as she job hunts.  Transgender is a term used for people who identify as a different gender from the one they were given at birth. Some undergo surgery or take hormones to change their bodies.  And as millions of Americans struggle with unemployment, this community is being hit especially hard.  Related: Transgender financial struggles: 'How we get by'  It's hard to pin down a precise jobless rate since there's so little transgender-specific data available. The most recent comprehensive study of more than 6,000 transgender individuals was released in 2011 by the National Center for Transgender Equality. This report found the transgender jobless rate to be 14% -- double the national rate -- and as high as 28% for black respondents. And a recent online Prudential survey of 49 transgender individuals had similar findings.  Keisha Allen, a black, 45-year-old transgender woman, has been working as a prostitute since her mother kicked her out of the house at age 16 for being transgender. She makes less than $12,000 a year and lives at a homeless shelter, where she is forced to stay in the men's section. She has applied for hundreds of entry-level jobs that don't require a college degree -- from dishwashers to cashiers -- without making it past the first interview.  \"Once I get to the interview and my name doesn't match my ID and my body doesn't match what it says on my ID, I never hear back,\" said Allen. \"My only way of survival is through sex.\"  Even those who find jobs often end up taking significant pay cuts, said Lisa Mottet, director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force's Transgender Civil Rights Project.  Jennifer Chavez, 55, has 40 years of experience in the auto industry but said she was terminated from her job as a mechanic just two months after telling her boss she planned to transition from male to female. Upon finding out about her transition, she said co-workers stopped talking to her and her boss even told her an applicant had turned down a job because of her. Soon, word about her transition spread.  Related: I'm unemployed and hopeless  \"[P]rior to my transition, getting a job was nothing,\" said Chavez. \"After my transition, a huge segment of Atlanta in the auto service world knew about me, so I was blackballed from all the auto dealerships.\"  More than 300 applications later, she landed a full-time, commission-based technician job at Pep Boys, where her potential annual earnings are around $35,000 -- half of what she previously made. As a result, she has barely been able to hold on to her home.  Many transgender individuals aren't able to afford a home at all. Homelessness among this group is estimated to be double the national rate, according to the NCTE study. Respondents were also nearly four times more likely to have annual household incomes of less than $10,000, and 16% said they resorted to sex work or drug dealing for income -- a percentage that nearly doubled for the unemployed and skyrocketed to 53% for black respondents.  Medical bills can also be a problem. Tim Chevalier, a 32-year-old transsexual man from California, has a high-paying job as a software engineer at Mozilla. But he's still struggling to make ends meet after racking up $50,000 in medical bills from his reconstructive surgery and related medical costs that insurance wouldn't cover.  Help for the unemployed  A growing number of programs are being launched to help the transgender community.  The LGBT Community Center in San Francisco assists transgender job seekers with decisions like which name to include on a resume -- the one from their previous sex or their new name -- whether to bring up their transition to a potential employer or to come out to past employers in case they are called as a reference.  It also started offering a computer coding class late last year -- a skill in high demand. The first class of 15 people is in its second semester, and the center will try to connect them with companies in the area like Twitter and Google upon graduation.  The Chicago House, a facility for people with HIV/AIDS in Chicago, is launching transgender-specific housing and a four-week employment program offering job search advice, career counseling and even help with makeup and clothing before job interviews.  Programs like this are especially important in the aftermath of the economic downturn, since transgender people were often the first to be laid off and last to be hired, said Mottet.  But a federal law protecting transgender workers remains crucial to getting to the root of the unemployment problem, advocacy groups say. And there's growing optimism it could happen, with state anti-discrimination laws that specifically protect transgender employees now covering 45% of the population -- up from 5% about 10 years ago.  Related: Heroes helping others find jobs  Even so, it's often hard to prove a discrimination case.  In one of the biggest recent victories, Vandy Beth Glenn sued the Georgia General Assembly for firing her immediately after she told her boss that she planned to transition from male to female. A federal appeals court based in Atlanta ruled that treating her differently due to her gender identity violated the Constitution's Equal Protection clause. Glenn was given back her job editing proposed state legislation, and the court even went on to rule that public and private employers can't fire transgender workers because of their gender identity, said Greg Nevins, an attorney at Lambda Legal who represented Glenn.  \"Once [employers] are aware of what is prohibited, I think it will get rid of a lot of the barriers to transgender individuals having the right to earn a living and be part of the workforce,\" said Nevins.

It's the latest blow to the people and businesses of Puerto Rico who are living through a major economic crisis. Taxes have gone up (the sales tax is now 11.5%), jobs are scare (unemployment is 11.7%), home values are plummeting. People are literally fleeing the island at a rate not seen since the 1950s \"West Side Story\" era.  \"Everything is more expensive in Puerto Rico right now,\" says Father Enrique Camacho, head of the Catholic Charities on the island. \"People are really not able to pay for utilities, rent, or school for their children.\"  Related: Puerto Rico's crisis: How did it get so bad?

The island's electric utility is in desperate need of cash, which is why it proposed the rate hikes. In the meantime, it is also getting concessions from creditors by delaying payments to them and offering lower interest rates to some bondholders.  The electric rate hikes are another reminder that the pain from Puerto Rico's crisis continues to hurt people, and will for some time. On Thursday night, Congress passed a bill to help Puerto Rico work out its debt. It was a bipartisan bill crafted with the Republican Congress and President Obama's administration.

That sobering GDP report dashed hopes for a spring rebound from the first quarter's anemic 0.8% growth pace.   Related: U.S. emerges as safe haven amid chaotic world  Stocks may be more vulnerable to disappointing news because of how far they've climbed lately. The Dow is currently sitting at 18,400, or roughly 3,000 points above its mid-February low. That's a huge move.  Goldman isn't going out on a limb by warning of possible turmoil in the next few months. History shows the August/September period can be rough for stocks. Those two months are the worst for the S&P 500 in terms of monthly price increases since World War II, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.  The challenges may be greater this time around. Not only does growth remain elusive for much of the globe, but there is a lot of uncertainty about policy. Goldman cited the Brexit negotiations in Europe, China's attempt to manage its slowdown and the looming presidential election in the U.S.  The other problem is that stocks look pricey. The S&P 500 is trading at 17.87 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, the loftiest multiple since June 2004, according to S&P.  Related: Stocks can predict the election winner  The bulls are hoping that earnings, the real driver of stock prices, will catch up to the market. While tech companies like Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) have reported blockbuster profits, the S&P 500 is still on track to report its fourth consecutive quarter of shrinking earnings.  Even if profits don't rebound, the markets have been supported by extremely low bond yields that make stocks look cheaper by comparison. But many worry that bonds are in the middle of a massive bubble that will eventually reverse.  All of this explains why Goldman Sachs is advising clients to put money into cash. Some investors are doing just that. The average Openfolio portfolio in July held 10.3% in cash, up from 8.2% in May.  But Goldman isn't telling people to keep their money under the mattress. The firm remains neutral on stocks over the next 12 months and told investors to \"look for opportunities to re-enter upon pullback in equities.\" ", "date": "August 1, 2016: 11:07 AM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/01/investing/goldman-sachs-sell-stocks/index.html", "author": "Matt Egan"},
{"text": "Contrary to the ominous picture painted by Donald Trump, America has once again emerged as a port of safety for investors navigating the stormy world. The U.S. stock market is sitting near record highs and the Dow is up an incredible 3,100 points since the mid-February low.  A big factor powering the move: the U.S. is looking like a haven of stability amid all the global turmoil. And investors are betting on that safety with their dollars.  Just look at the laundry list of global concerns: deep uncertainty sparked by Brexit; renewed European bank concerns; low oil prices hitting energy-centric economies like Brazil; unnerving emergency moves by the Bank of Japan and fresh memories of market turbulence in China. That's not to mention the coup in Turkey, a former darling of Eastern Europe.  \"Who's left standing? We're not the least worst now. We're best,\" said David Kotok, an influential money manager who cofounded Cumberland Advisors.  Another forceful driver of the rally on Wall Street is that investors don't have that many choices right now, and stocks look great next to bonds that are yielding next to nothing these days recently.  Related: Show me the money! Dividends all the rage  Paying up for stability  With all these factors at play, investors have rewarded America with far richer valuations than its peers. The U.S. MSCI index of U.S. stocks trades for a lofty 17.4 times estimated forward earnings, according to Yardeni Research. That's the equivalent of a massive vote of confidence when compared with more conservative multiples assigned for the U.K. (15.9), Eurozone (13.4) and Japan (13.1).  More recently, money has started rushing into emerging markets. But these less mature economies remain cheap. The MSCI emerging market index is trading at just 12 times forward earnings. The Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) is not even close to its pre-Great Recession highs, despite a 12% rally this year.  So even though U.S. stocks are pricey -- and many would say outright expensive -- investors have been willing to pay up for the stability.  \"Where do investors go? It's all a relative game -- and the U.S. looks relatively attractive,\" said Casey Clark, vice president of investment strategy research at Glenmede Trust.  Related: It's a scary world...except for defense companies  Economy better than campaign rhetoric  Interestingly enough, just a few months earlier, there were fears of a near-term recession in the U.S. as the year kicked off with very slow growth in the economy. But those have faded in recent months.  While \"angry politicians on both extremes will say the country is headed in the wrong direction\" JPMorgan Funds chief global strategist David Kelly believes the numbers say otherwise.  \"This tortoise-like expansion is generating steady growth, low unemployment and record level of wealth,\" Kelly wrote in a client note. \"Logic still suggests this is still a good time to be invested in risk assets.\"  Of course, just because the U.S. has been looked at as a safe haven doesn't mean it will stay that way indefinitely.  First, many have warned that stock market valuations in the U.S. have gotten stretched and a pullback may be coming if earnings don't improve significantly.  David Bianco, chief equity strategist at Deutsche Bank, believes a 5% to 9% \"dip\" in the S&P 500 is \"likely\" given that investors \"seem too excited about improving growth\" and have become \"complacent\" about low bond yields. \"We think the bull continues, but patience will be rewarded,\" Bianco wrote in a note on Monday.  What about November election?  And then there's the looming U.S. election. Up until now, investors have not been spooked by the possibility of Trump taking the White House. Either they don't think he'll win or they believe his tough talk on trade is just bluster.  Will that thinking change given that new polls, including a CNN one released on Monday, show support for Trump is on the rise after last week's GOP convention? Stay tuned.  \"Now we have our own political theater unfolding. We're going to have massive volatility because of politics,\" said Cumberland's Kotok.

{"text": "Puerto Rico is losing a doctor a day. Justin Maldonado learned that fact in the most tragic way possible.  His uncle had a stroke in the summer of 2014. The family rushed him to a local hospital in Coamo. The emergency room doctors recommended that his uncle be taken immediately to a neurologist.  Then the Maldonado family was told only two neurologists were on duty for an entire island of 3.5 million people. It was a holiday weekend.  Related: Puerto Rico in Crisis  His uncle died several days later.  \"Don't get hurt in Puerto Rico, especially on a holiday or a Sunday,\" says Maldonado. Occasionally, he drives by the hospital where his uncle died. There are always people waiting. The family has taken to calling the lines \"the walking dead.\"  Related: Puerto Rico has become 'dead dog island'  In 2014, 364 doctors left the island never to return, the Puerto Rican Surgeons and Physicians Association says. Last year, 500 doctors packed up. Most moved for more lucrative positions in the mainland U.S.  The island is in a financial crisis of its own -- it doesn't have enough money to pay back over $70 billion in debt. On Wednesday, the House Committee on Natural Resources is holding another hearing to determine what to do. There's been a lot of attention on whether to allow Puerto Rico to declare bankruptcy (or something like it).  But the deeper problem is that the island has been in an economic crisis for a decade. That's why doctors -- and other professionals -- are fleeing. Puerto Rico has lost over 10% of its population in the past decade. Jobs just aren't there and home values are plummeting.  On top of that, Medicare reimburses doctors far less in Puerto Rico than other states.  Related: I've lost over $200,000 on Puerto Rican bonds  \"I have a hard time recruiting. We can't compete with institutions in the U.S.,\" says Dr. Fernando Luis Joglar. He's a vascular surgeon and president of the American College of Surgeons Puerto Rico Chapter.  He gets offers all the time from hospitals in the mainland United States. Many come via letter or postcard. His wife leaves them out on the kitchen table for him to see when he arrives home.  She doesn't even have to say it out loud, why are they still in Puerto Rico?  For Dr. Joglar, it's because his family is there and he worries what will happen if he leaves. His specialty is a lot like neurology. There are only a handful of vascular surgeons left who operate on veins and arteries. If he goes, he believes corpses will pile up.  \"The recession is getting worse. It's effecting private hospitals. They're closing,\" says Dr. Joglar.  Related: Puerto Rico might CUT its minimum wage  Congress has promised to take some sort of action to aid the island in its time of crisis, likely before a huge debt payment is due to creditors in July. There's a push to give Puerto Rico more federal Medicare and Medicaid funding in the final bill. But the initial \"discussion draft\" legislation didn't include any additional health care money.  Governor Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla has gone as far as to declare a \"humanitarian crisis\" on the island. His office notes that Puerto Rico \"receives less than half the federal healthcare funding of any of the 50 states.\" The Zika virus outbreak has only stressed the island's medical system further.  \"If they don't stop the bleeding now, this is going to get super ugly by the end of the year,\" says Maldonado.

{"text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook has unveiled two new iPhones as well as the new Apple TV, iPad Pro and Apple Watches. The new iGadgets were unveiled during a press event Wednesday at San Francisco's Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.  iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus  \"While they may look familiar, we have changed everything about these new iPhones,\" said Tim Cook.  Apple has updated its two smartphones. The new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are available in four colors: silver, gold, space gray and rose gold. The devices are now made from 7000 series aluminum, which is an aircraft-grade material. It's stronger than the previous phone aluminum and is unlikely to bend.  The devices' biggest addition is a 3D touch screen, a feature introduced on Apple trackpads and the Apple Watch, that was previously known as Force Touch. The technology recognizes new gestures like pressing and holding. It vibrates slightly to let you know it's been pressed.  The new iPhones also come with a 12 megapixel iSight rear camera, with 50% more pixels than the iPhone 6. The front-facing camera is now 5 megapixels (for sharper selfies).  A kooky new photography feature called \"Live Photos\" combines photos and videos. When you take a photo with the Live Photo setting on, it records a second-and-a-half video before and after the clip to make a tiny little video. Press and hold on your photo and it will play.  The phones also have the new A9 processor and faster fingerprint sensors. There are new charging docks to match the colors of the iPhones as well as new covers.  The phones will cost the same as the last version (starting at $650 and $750 for the 6S Plus). The previous versions (iPhone 6 and 6 Plus) will each drop $100.  A new iPhone Upgrade program lets you lease an iPhone for $32 a month and get a new version every year.  The new iPhones will go on pre-sale on September 12 and will hit stores on September 25. IOS 9 will be available on September 16 for anyone with an iPhone as old as an iPhone 4S.  iPad Pro   As expected, Apple is making a bigger, faster iPad. The iPad Pro is 12.9 inches. It's the same height as the iPad Air, so you can run iPad Air apps side by side. The screen has 5.6 million pixels -- more than a 15-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display.  The iPad Pro starts at $799.  Inside it's much faster. The iPad Pro has a new A9X 64-bit chip. It's 1.8 times faster than the previous iPad's CPU (\"desktop class\" according to Apple executive Phil Schiller). It is powerful enough to edit three streams of 4K video at a time. It has a 10-hour battery life, is super thin and weighs just over 1.5 pounds.  \"Why make an iPad with a bigger display?\" asked Schiller. Good question!  Games and movies look better on a bigger screen, he said. It's big enough to have a full-size keyboard on the screen. If you don't want to type on the screen, Apple has made a new smart keyboard that doubles as a cover, Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) Surface-style. The keyboard is coated with a thin fabric.  The company is also making its own stylus, but with the usual over-the-top design and marketing. Yes, it's the Apple Pencil, a low latency stylus that feels like a real pencil. It even got its own Jony Ive narrated videos. It \"feels like a true writing or drawing instrument,\" said Ive.  As the name implies, the iPad Pro's real target audience is business users. To show that it's serious, Apple brought out a very unexpected partner to demo the iPad Pro: Microsoft's Kirk Konenigsbauer. He demonstrated Microsoft Office for iPad Pro using the Apple Pencil.   Adobe (ADBE) also demoed its iPad Pro apps including a new product called Photoshop Fix, a retouching tool. Using the iPad Pro and new stylus, Adobe's Eric Snowden did some realtime edits including the odd choice of changing a photo of a model to make her smile more. (It was the first woman on stage during the presentation.)  For the final demo, Irene Walsh from 3D4Medical showed off her startup's 3D medical app that shows 3D interactive anatomy images for medical students and patients.  The company also announced a new iPad Mini 4.  Apple TV  \"We believe the future of television is apps,\" said Tim Cook before introducing the expected new Apple TV.  The latest Apple TV features a third-party App Store, a new remote, Siri controls and a completely overhauled operating system. The TV now runs on tvOS, which is based on iOS and \"built for the living room,\" according to Apple's Eddie Cue.  The device will start shipping in October and cost $149 for the 32 GB version and $199 for 64 GB.  The new black remote features a glass touch surface on the top half, so you can navigate the Apple TV with swipes and other gestures. The Bluetooth remote has volume controls for the TV and a built-in accelerometer and gyroscope. It can last three months on one charge. It recharges using a Lightning connector.  Too lazy to swipe? Tell Siri what you want, like, \"Siri, show me a New Girl episode with Jamie Lee Curtis in it.\" If you miss something, say, \"Siri, what did she say?\" and the episode will rewind a few seconds and turn on captions. Don't know what you want to watch, Siri can make movie and TV suggestions based on things like genre.  Siri searches across all apps, so you don't have to jump between HBO Go and Netflix to find something specific.  The biggest boost for the device is opening it up to third-party developers. You can use the device to play multiplayer games. Apple demoed a few examples, including Harmonix's Beat Sports and Hipster Whale's Crossy Road. Another app by Gilt lets you shop directly from the Apple TV. MLB has an Apple TV app for watching multiple live games at a time with pop-up notifications and interactive stats.  Apple Watch  The company kicked off the event with an update about the Apple Watch.  Fashionistas now have more band options. The biggest addition is a wrap-around brown leather Herm\u00e9s band, which will be available in October. The watch itself now comes in gold and rose gold, and there are new sports band options as well.  The smart device was released in April. There are now more than 10,000 watch apps, including a few new important additions. Facebook Messenger's app will let you send text, audio and location messages. GoPro's app acts as a viewfinder for your camera. iTranslate lets you speak a word and get a translation and AirStrip is a tool for medical professionals. It's also adding transit directions to the included Maps app.  Related: The iPhone through the years  ", "date": "September 10, 2015: 8:45 AM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/09/technology/apple-iphone-6s-announcement/index.html", "author": "Heather Kelly"},
{"text": "While more than 59 million Americans get Social Security checks each month, hardly anyone is an expert on how the benefits program works. In fact, most people don't even know the basics. About 70% of people who took a 10-question quiz about Social Security facts flunked, answering three or more of the questions incorrectly. A lot of people didn't know how old they have to be to get the biggest Social Security payments possible, or whether they can collect based on their ex-spouse's earnings.  Only one person out of 1,513 people who took the quiz got a perfect score. (It was a retired woman from the South that scored 100%.) The group was surveyed by the life insurance company MassMutual and included people 18 and older, though 40% of them were over 50.  Without a basic understanding, Americans might be \"underutilizing\" Social Security, said Michael Fanning at MassMutual.  Social Security is a lifeline for many retirees, making up more than half of income for 52% of married couples and 74% of singles, according to the Social Security Administration.  Here are some questions that stumped the crowd.  About 70% incorrectly believed that they can get their full Social Security benefits at 65. It actually depends on when you were born, but for most people it's 67. You can start receiving Social Security as early as 62, but doing so reduces your monthly payment for the rest of your life.  More than half wrongly thought they can receive their full benefit payment while continuing to work. You can get Social Security while you work, but some of the payments will be withheld if you're pulling in over a certain amount of money -- until you reach your full retirement age.  About half were unaware that they can collect Social Security based on their ex-spouse's earnings. As long as you were married for at least 10 years and are now single, you are eligible for a bigger Social Security check if your ex made more money than you.  Three-quarters of people incorrectly thought citizenship is necessary to receive benefits. It's not, but you must have legal resident alien status and permission to work in the U.S.  To test yourself, take the MassMutual quiz here.

{"text": "The all-new Apple TV has gotten a true makeover: It has been jam-packed with new features, a new remote, new apps -- and a steep new price. Apple's latest set-top box costs $149 ($199 for the twice-as-spacious 64 GB model). That's more than double the $69 customers had to shell out for the last iteration.  So is it worth your money?  Let's take a look at the new Apple TV's features and compare them with the competition.  1. Siri  You can now yell at your TV -- and it will listen to you. It's a neat feature: Just touch the microphone button on your remote and tell your TV what you want to watch.  The Apple (AAPL, Tech30) TV lets you say commands like, \"Show me action movies,\" \"jump ahead 7 minutes,\" or even, \"What did she say?\" With that last feature, the Apple TV will go back a few seconds and turn on closed captioning.  The ability to speak to your television is hardly unique to Apple TV. The feature is baked into many smart TVs, as well as the Roku 3, Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Amazon's (AMZN, Tech30) Fire TV. It even comes standard on Comcast's (CCV) Xfinity cable boxes and remotes.  2. The touchpad remote  The new Apple TV remote features a glass touch surface so you can navigate the Apple TV with swipes and gestures.  It connects to the Apple TV via Bluetooth, so you don't need to point it right at the box (but you do need to charge it every three months). It lets you control the volume on your TV, and it has a Nintendo Wii-like built-in motion sensor, so you can play video games and use your remote as a virtual baseball bat or pool cue.  Though the touch surface is particular to the Apple TV, many competitors, including Google's Chromecast, Fire TV and many cable apps, allow you to search for programming directly on your smartphone. Touch is compelling but not necessarily a game changer.  3. Universal search  Apple TV will now search across multiple apps. So you can search for a movie, and it will show up on your screen whether it's on Netflix (NFLX, Tech30), Hulu, HBO or any number of other apps -- you no longer need to search inside every single app.  That's a fantastic feature -- but also not unique. The Roku, for example, lets you search by title, actor or director across all your apps.  4. Apps & tvOS  The new Apple TV will run on \"tvOS,\" which will feature a third-party app store. It will open up the set-top box to new third-party content, apps and games.  Apple has actually been a longtime holdout on opening up its set-top box to third parties. It has featured many TV networks and streaming services, but it never allowed games, apps and other third-party content the way that Roku, Amazon and Google have.  5. Promise for the future  Apple repeatedly said the new Apple TV is a \"a foundation for the future of television,\" not-so-subtly hinting that the device is ready for those pesky TV networks to play ball. So much of the content on Apple TV and its competitors requires you to have an existing cable subscription, but Apple could one day sell its own subscription service that allows you to bypass your cable company and get TV straight from Apple.  This is where Apple could do some real damage. It would seem to be in a far better position to do that than, say Roku, but content companies have also been tepid about accepting Apple as a partner after seeing how Apple dismantled the music market with iTunes.  Is the price right?  The Apple TV, which ships in October, costs far more than its direct competitors. The industry-leading Roku, for example, starts at $50 and goes up to $100. The top-of-the-line Roku 3 has virtually every feature that Apple announced, right down to the motion-control remote for games and voice search. But the Roku 3 offers more content, compatibility with non-Apple smartphones and PCs, as well as a headphone jack on the remote for private listening.  Even cheaper competitors include the $35 Google Chromecast and the $40 Amazon Fire Stick. Neither are as powerful as the Apple TV, but if all you want to do is stream movies, TV shows or play games (and, face it, that's probably all you need on your TV), you can get far more value for your money.  The Apple TV could be a more compelling product if Apple starts selling a subscription TV service alongside it. Until then, your money might be best spent elsewhere -- even on Apple's older set-top box, which can still be had relatively cheap.

{"text": "Is Apple about to enter the world of original programming, and if so, what sort of programming is it pursuing? Those questions are swirling in media circles after a Monday night report from Variety, a Hollywood news fixture, that Apple (AAPL, Tech30) is exploring such a move.  One thing is for certain: Apple executives are reaching out to high-level entertainment industry types for confidential talks.  An executive familiar with the outreach to Hollywood said Apple is assessing whether it should start to bankroll original TV shows and movies.  This would put Apple into close competition with streaming services like Netflix and traditional TV networks like ABC. At the same time, it could become a deep-pocketed new buyer of content from Hollywood studios.  The source cautioned that it is \"very early days.\"  Related: Hit movies moving from Netflix to Hulu with Epix deal  An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the Variety report, which also came with a number of caveats. \"The scale of Apple's ambitions vary depending on whom is asked,\" Variety said.  Apple could just be looking to expand what it's already doing with Apple Music, perhaps by financing music documentaries or concert films.  But the Hollywood meetings come at a time of intense competition for audience attention and subscription dollars.  Other companies' TV shows and movies already light up iPhone and iPad screens all around the world and make the Apple TV box worth buying.  Apple is expected to introduce a new version of Apple TV at a press event on September 9.  Looking further into the future, the company is interested in selling a cable-like bundle of TV channels via the Internet, but it has run into resistance from some major network owners.  And there are persistent rumors that the company could make its own big-screen TV someday.  Related: Apple Music exec quits two months after launch  However Apple may expand, having TV shows with the Apple stamp -- shows that aren't available anywhere else -- would distinguish the service.  \"Every service starts on catalog and moves to originals to compete and differentiate,\" Media ReDEFined publisher Jason Hirschorn told CNNMoney. \"Apple is no exception.\"  Hirschorn formerly held senior positions at MySpace, MTV and Sling Media. He floated the idea that an A-list star like Jon Stewart, recently departed from \"The Daily Show,\" could cut an exclusive deal with Apple.  Apple already operates its iTunes Store, which lets users buy movies, individual TV episodes and season passes. If the company doesn't move forward with a full-fledged streaming service, it could seek to add more exclusive content to that store.

{"text": "Bad loans are rising quickly at China's top banks. The slowdown in the world's second largest economy is taking its toll on large commercial banks as more and more businesses and people struggle to repay their debts.  Three of China's giant state-controlled banks reported their 2015 earnings late Wednesday. And all three posted big jumps in non-performing loans, the financial term for loans that have gone sour.  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (IDCBF), the country's largest lender by assets, said non-performing loans leaped 44% from a year earlier to about 180 billion yuan ($28 billion).  Its rivals China Construction Bank (CICHF) and Bank of China (BACHF) suffered increases of 47% and 30%, respectively, according to a CNNMoney analysis of their statements.  Related: China's central banker warns on high corporate debt  The worsening situation hasn't become a full-blown crisis yet -- the three banks have funds set aside to cover some losses and are all still generating tens of billions of dollars in profits.  But after years of strong growth, those profits hardly rose at all in 2015. China Construction Bank's net profit inched up just 0.1%.  And the companies don't appear to expect things to improve anytime soon.  \"China's economy will face great downward pressures, including pressures on asset quality,\" Bank of China warned in its outlook for this year. It pointed to the country's slowing growth and efforts by Chinese officials to shift the economy away from its reliance on exports and debt-fueled investment.

Related: China hits pain barrier on road to prosperity  Policymakers and analysts have expressed concern about the heavy debt load that the Chinese economy has amassed during its years of rapid expansion.  \"Rising non-performing loans in China's banks are the direct result of an unprecedented 5-year debt binge and a slowing economy,\" the consulting firm PwC said in a report last year.  The governor of China's central bank warned earlier this month that overall debt levels, particularly among corporations, were \"on the high side\" and pose risks to the economy.  The big banks are backed by China's government, and authorities would be expected to step in if bad loans rise too high and threaten the lenders' solvency.  Chinese officials have talked about introducing measures to try to tackle the huge corporate debt load, including allowing companies to pay off loans with shares rather than cash.

{"text": "Apple hasn't announced what its next step into television will look like, but CBS Corporation CEO Les Moonves has an idea. He met with Apple executive Eddy Cue just last week. Moonves said Wednesday that Apple wants to sell an Internet subscription to a \"select group of channels\" at a price lower than traditional TV bundles.  His remarks, at Re/code's annual Code Conference in southern California, confirm  March's news reports about Apple's negotiations with networks like CBS.  Related: is this the Apple product that will reinvent television?  Moonves said CBS would \"probably\" participate, if -- pardon the CBS game show reference -- the price is right for CBS.  By selling a cable-like bundle of channels via the Internet, Apple would join two companies, Dish Network and Sony, that are offering similar services. Other companies are poised to join them.  Related: who else will sell 'Internet cable?'  Charter's chief executive Tom Rutledge said Tuesday that Charter might do so after its merger with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks.  The idea is that the relatively small bundles will be appealing to customers who don't want or can't afford traditional cable hookups. In the industry, these are sometimes called \"skinny bundles.\" Over time, they may imperil the niche cable channels that many people see on their lineups, but rarely if ever watch.  So far, Dish and Sony's services haven't received much attention. But Apple has market power like no other player. Cue is the executive in charge of iTunes and the App Store, which give Apple a direct connection to hundreds of millions of customers.  The company's Apple TV box has also sold more than 25 million units.  \"Apple TV is trying to change the universe a little bit,\" Moonves reportedly said, while mentioning Dish and Sony's products as well.  Not surprisingly, he emphasized that any Apple service would need CBS, since it's the most-watched broadcast network.  CBS's contracts with its affiliates could be a complicating factor. There are CBS-affiliated stations all across the country; Re/code reported last week that Apple \"wants to provide customers in cities around the U.S. with programming from their local broadcast stations,\" but the contractual challenges are significant.  Moonves didn't comment on that particular issue at the conference on Wednesday.

{"text": "Is Apple about to enter the world of original programming, and if so, what sort of programming is it pursuing? Those questions are swirling in media circles after a Monday night report from Variety, a Hollywood news fixture, that Apple (AAPL, Tech30) is exploring such a move.  One thing is for certain: Apple executives are reaching out to high-level entertainment industry types for confidential talks.  An executive familiar with the outreach to Hollywood said Apple is assessing whether it should start to bankroll original TV shows and movies.  This would put Apple into close competition with streaming services like Netflix and traditional TV networks like ABC. At the same time, it could become a deep-pocketed new buyer of content from Hollywood studios.  The source cautioned that it is \"very early days.\"  Related: Hit movies moving from Netflix to Hulu with Epix deal  An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the Variety report, which also came with a number of caveats. \"The scale of Apple's ambitions vary depending on whom is asked,\" Variety said.  Apple could just be looking to expand what it's already doing with Apple Music, perhaps by financing music documentaries or concert films.  But the Hollywood meetings come at a time of intense competition for audience attention and subscription dollars.  Other companies' TV shows and movies already light up iPhone and iPad screens all around the world and make the Apple TV box worth buying.  Apple is expected to introduce a new version of Apple TV at a press event on September 9.  Looking further into the future, the company is interested in selling a cable-like bundle of TV channels via the Internet, but it has run into resistance from some major network owners.  And there are persistent rumors that the company could make its own big-screen TV someday.  Related: Apple Music exec quits two months after launch  However Apple may expand, having TV shows with the Apple stamp -- shows that aren't available anywhere else -- would distinguish the service.  \"Every service starts on catalog and moves to originals to compete and differentiate,\" Media ReDEFined publisher Jason Hirschorn told CNNMoney. \"Apple is no exception.\"  Hirschorn formerly held senior positions at MySpace, MTV and Sling Media. He floated the idea that an A-list star like Jon Stewart, recently departed from \"The Daily Show,\" could cut an exclusive deal with Apple.  Apple already operates its iTunes Store, which lets users buy movies, individual TV episodes and season passes. If the company doesn't move forward with a full-fledged streaming service, it could seek to add more exclusive content to that store.  But it was easy to find skepticism about the Apple talks on Monday night along with serious prognostications and wishful thinking.  \"You guys,\" media industry consultant Rex Sorgatz tweeted, \"Apple will make a car, a spaceship, and a social network before it makes a TV show.\" ", "date": "August 31, 2015: 10:29 PM ET", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/31/media/apple-original-content/index.html?iid=Lead", "author": "Brian Stelter"},

A full 85% of the company's tech workers, and 77% of its management team, are also men.  The company's U.S. workforce is 57% white, 34% Asian, 4% Hispanic and 2% black.  \"As these numbers show, we have more work to do -- a lot more,\" Maxine Williams, Facebook's global head of diversity, said in a statement.  The report shows that while Facebook (FB, Tech30) has women including \"Lean In\" author Sheryl Sandberg in prominent positions, diversity at the company is roughly in line with rivals including Google, Yahoo and LinkedIn.

Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson has appeared at several annual meetings of tech companies this spring, including Google and Facebook, to urge them to do more to recruit African American and Hispanic workers.  The true scale of the industry's diversity problem is difficult to determine, largely because most major tech companies have closely guarded their data.  Starting in 2011, CNNMoney probed 20 of the most influential U.S. tech firms. Almost all refused to provide numbers on workplace diversity.  When Freedom of Information Act requests were filed by CNNMoney, Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ, Tech30), Google (GOOG), IBM (IBM, Tech30) and Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) all successfully petitioned the Department of Labor to exclude their data.

{"text": "In 1963, whisky makers at a distillery in Scotland filled up a cask and sealed it with the knowledge it would not be opened again for 50 years. Its contents have been watched over for the last half century by David Stewart, a highly respected whisky master for Scotland's Balvenie distillery. The cask was recently opened and bottled, and its contents are now available for purchase. A limited number of Balvenie Fifty bottles exist, and come with a suggested retail price of $38,000.  \"It's spicy,\" said Stewart, as he swirled a taste of it in his glass and breathed it in. \"There's ginger, nutmeg, dried fruits and dates.\"  His nose knows, and he's spent his life mostly smelling whisky rather than tasting it. Smell is a vital part of his job, and a large part of what makes him the malt master. He's only the fifth person to hold that job in Balvenie's 125-year history. \"We last a long time in the company,\" he said.  Related: Would you order this $78 taco?  The company is known for its handcrafted spirits. Part of what drives the price is the way the whisky is made, which hasn't changed much in the last century. The barley is still malted in-house, and Balvenie is only one of six distilleries with its own malting floor out of the 100 or so distilleries in Scotland.  That keeps the quality controlled, and means the distillery is only getting barley from the local farms around it, some of which have supplied the company for decades.  That's not all that gives the Balvenie Fifty its eye-popping price tag. It's special -- and expensive -- because of its rarity, partly due to the fact that the yield from each cask isn't that high.  A cask usually yields about 400 bottles. The cask that held the Balvenie Fifty only yielded 131, and there are only 15 of the bottles available in the United States.  The low yield is because over time, whisky in the cask evaporates. It can lose its alcohol content too, which isn't good -- a whisky has to have an alcohol content of at least 40% to be labeled Scotch whisky.  At 45.4%, the 50-year-old just made it.  \"We got lucky it stayed above strength,\" Stewart said. He spent the last decade keeping an extra eye on the alcohol content tests. \"It's about patience. If anything, you're doing experiments.\"  And while the experiments sometimes take place in the distillery's laboratory, Stewart prefers to keep it old school. \"The nose always gets the final say,\" he said.

The company's 98,000 worldwide employees are 70% male, a figure that jumps to 72% for leadership roles and 80% for technical positions.  \"As CEO, I'm not satisfied with the numbers on this page,\" Apple chief Tim Cook said in an open letter accompanying the figures. \"They're not new to us, and we've been working hard for quite some time to improve them.\"  There's been a renewed focus on Silicon Valley diversity in recent months, with companies like Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) pulling back the veils on their workforce stats for the first time. Apple had not previously disclosed its employee diversity statistics.  Apple's diversity figures are notable because Apple's employee count includes more than 41,000 Apple Store workers, most of whom earn an hourly wage. Apple's competitors, meanwhile, have a higher percentage of workers in technical positions.

The nation's overall population is about 63% white, 17% Hispanic, 13% African American and 5% Asian, according the Census Bureau, with women making up 49% of the work force.  Cook noted that Apple (AAPL, Tech30) has hired a handful of female executives of late, including new retail head Angela Ahrendts and environmental initiatives leader Lisa Jackson, and that it recently pledged $100 million to improve technology in underprivileged schools.

{"text": "It's happy hour at an underground bar in Manhattan, and Leanne Pittsford is asking lesbians in tech what they want. \"You are all influencers,\" she says. \"You know what's going on here.\"  LGBT women are advancing in the tech world, but they need help finding support in such a male-dominated field.  Pittsford, founder of the group Lesbians Who Tech, will be hosting a summit in New York later this year, and set up the happy hour to crowdsource what would make the event successful.  Lesbians Who Tech, which got its start at a bar in San Francisco in 2012, has grown to include 9,000 members worldwide.  The organization is just one of many that help LGBT women connect with each other, start their own businesses and access a growing network of LGBT mentors and investors. It's a serious need, given that women in tech earn significantly less than men and are less satisfied with their jobs, according to a Glassdoor study released last year.  \"When we come together, we can start thinking of some of these issues and tackling them,\" Pittsford said, adding that she doesn't always see LGBT issues as part of the bigger conversation about diversity in Silicon Valley.  \"We all know there are too few women in tech. Parse that down to lesbians in tech and there are very few,\" said Marie Trexler, head of the lesbian entrepreneur mentoring program for StartOut, a nonprofit working to create more LGBT-identified business leaders. \"Sexual identity isn't always front and center in your business life, but it can be, and it can be very valuable.\"  Related: Lesbian dating app secures $1 million in funding  A few years ago, Trexler started attending gay tech events, but found, unsurprisingly, that the crowd was mostly male.  \"Often it would be me, two or three female friends and 50 to 60 guys,\" said Trexler, an experienced venture capitalist.  When she started asking lesbians in tech what they wanted, mentoring was repeated over and over.  \"The role modeling component really does make a difference,\" said Trexler.  With StartOut's lesbian entrepreneurship program, each mentee is paired with a mentor for six months. Trexler said one of the biggest challenges for the mentees is funding, which is true for female entrepreneurs across the board.  Related: Record number of U.S. firms offering same-sex benefits   Several funds have been launched to support LGBT-identified entrepreneurs.  VentureOut funds seed-stage startups founded by business leaders in the LGBT community. LGBT Capital takes a different angle, supporting companies that target the LGBT consumer market.  Pitching investors is a big part of Trexler's program.  It made a difference for B. Cole, founder of Brioxy, a soon-to-be-launched platform that helps young people of color find fellowships. She completed the StartOut program last year.  \"As a person of color who identifies as a lesbian and someone gender non-conforming, the deck is stacked, so they say,\" she said. The program helped her identify investors and build a network.  She is looking to raise $500,000 in the next year, to add to the $15,000 she raised on Indiegogo last year. \"I'm ready to increase the size of the team and go after a larger market share,\" she said.  For women who may not want to build their own startups, but still have their sights set on tech, Pittsford said events like hers bring inspiring women together.  At one summit, Megan Smith, who President Obama named as U.S. chief technology officer last year, gave a talk and then stayed to talk to attendees.  Pittsford said the line to get face time with Smith was nearly out the door, and it's women like her that provide a solid role model not just for LGBT women, but women everywhere.  That means a lot to Pittsford, who said that before she started her organization, women said they didn't even have one person they looked up to who was in tech and a lesbian.  \"I thought, 'There is something we can solve here,'\" she said.

{"text": "Vultures. People who lent Puerto Rico money and now expect to be paid are being portrayed as greedy vultures. But Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt crisis isn't just a battle between New York hedge funds and a cash-strapped little island.  About 30% of the debt is held by middle class Puerto Ricans like Teresa and Julio Garcia. Another 15% is held by other \"average Joe\" Americans who invested in bond funds.  \"The government says the bonds are in the hands of vultures. That's not true,\" says Teresa, a life-long Puerto Rican. \"I'm not a vulture.\"  The Garcias are retirees. They gush about their grandchildren. And they love Puerto Rico. Teresa was born in the city of Ponce -- \"the most beautiful place,\" she claims.  When the Garcias used their life savings to buy about $500,000 worth of Puerto Rican bonds in 2005, they thought it was a safe -- and patriotic -- investment. The bonds were AAA rated and backed by the government.  What seemed like a win-win is now a nightmare for the Garcias. They've lost over $200,000.  Many Puerto Ricans face a triple whammy of pain: their bonds are worth a lot less, their taxes are going up and their home values are plunging because of a mass population exodus from the island.  In a special investigation, CNNMoney met with numerous Puerto Rican bondholders. Their stories put a face on the crisis. The government's latest proposal to pay bondholders roughly half what they are owed would hurt hedge funds, but also regular people.  Related: There's a big sale on Puerto Rican homes  Joaquin Garcia de la Noceda is 57. He's not sure he'll ever be able to retire because of the Puerto Rican bond crisis.  In 2001, he invested about $200,000 in the bonds. He says his initial investment has fallen 60%.  De la Noceda is a locksmith, not an investment expert. His financial advisor recommended buying the bonds. Now the advisor claims, \"This is something that no one anticipated.\"  \"People say the rich will pay Puerto Rico's debt, but I am not rich\" says de la Noceda, who just finished paying for his daughter to attend university and is assisting his 96-year-old mother.  He and his wife run a locksmith businesses. The island's crisis is hurting that too. Companies are closing because of a prolonged recession, and the government is delaying payments that it owes businesses.  De la Noceda used to get paid within about a month of doing a job. Now it typically takes 60 to 90 days, even if he is doing work for a private company.  Related: How to build a $100 million company out of mud   People of all ages bought the bonds. One was tech entrepreneur Carlos Melendez.  \"I will never buy Puerto Rican bonds again,\" he told CNNMoney. He views his investment as \"basically a write off.\" At age 40, he's lucky he didn't invest too much in the bonds and has time to save more.  Melendez is exactly the type of person Puerto Rico needs right now. He grew up on the island and has a law degree. Fluent in English and Spanish, he became a tech expert and worked in Minnesota for a big U.S. firm for awhile but moved back to the island.  In 2003, he co-founded the software company Wovenware, which now has 32 employees. Wovenware's offices are in San Juan's Santurce neighborhood -- the island's equivalent of Brooklyn. It's a hip area that's one of the few places visibly growing and improving.  \"We decided to stay and make it work. Someone has to stay,\" says Melendez.  Related: Puerto Rico's brain drain crisis   Carlos Alberto Ponce de Leon will turn 68 in March. He's still working -- running a small business now -- because his retirement fund has lost 60% of its value.  An engineer, de Leon worked for many years at the island's power electric utility (known as PREPA). He'll never forget going to a seminar at PREPA for people who were about to retire. He claims the folks who ran the seminar advised workers to invest in Puerto Rican bonds.  They would be \"secure\" and \"conservative.\" They came with a good interest rate and special tax exemptions. Plus the workers would be \"doing this for Puerto Rico,\" much like people who U.S. bonds during World War II.  He invested several hundred thousand dollars in 2001 and added more in the following years.  \"I cannot recover 40 years of work. This represents the savings of my life,\" he told CNNMoney. Today de Leon hardly ever goes out to eat. He drives a 1986 car and his work van is from 1996.

Around age 55, she went to UBS, one of the big banks on the island. Her financial advisor there told her to put some money into Puerto Rican bonds and some in a fixed income fund. It turns out that fund was also heavily invested in Puerto Rican bonds.  \"I cry every day,\" she told CNNMoney. She has lost over $1 million. Rodriguez estimates that she has about 36% of her initial investment left. That's how much a firm recently offered her to buy her stake.  \"We have worked hard and honestly. They have robbed us of what we have,\" says Maria.  She and her husband Gabriel are focused on their children and grandchildren. Her daughter has health issues, so she is trying to support her and the little ones.  \"I don't spend. I give it all to my grandchildren,\" says Rodriguez.

We were expecting that with Social Security and our bond earnings, we would have enough money to be OK and secure,\" says Julio Garcia, age 77.  The value of their bonds has dropped in half. Fortunately, they did have other investments, but the majority of their retirement savings was in Puerto Rican debt. Today they receive about $1,000 less than what they expected each month.  It means they don't go out to movies or dinner much. They save to see their grandchildren in Arizona. Their children moved there because there weren't any jobs on the island for them.  \"I have been many places -- Europe, Canada, the U.S., other islands. Still, I find Puerto Rico so beautiful.

{"text": "China's efforts to try to tackle its $1.3 trillion risky loan problem could end up making the situation even worse, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Corporate debt in China is estimated to have risen to about 160% of GDP, a high level compared with other developing economies. And it's continuing to increase.  That's not healthy at a time when China's annual economic growth is at its weakest in 25 years and when companies are finding it harder to service their debts.  The IMF estimates that the amount of loans potentially at risk stands at $1.3 trillion, or 12% of the entire economy.  And in a report published Tuesday, it warned that the two techniques that China has reportedly identified to deal with the huge debt load -- converting bad loans into equity or repackaging them into securities -- won't work if other issues aren't addressed at the same time.  Related: Chinese firms are becoming 'allergic' to hiring  \"Unless they are carefully designed and part of a sound overall framework, they could actually worsen the problem, for example, by allowing 'zombie' firms to keep going,\" the report said.  \"Banks generally also don't have the expertise to run or restructure a business,\" it said. Taking a stake in companies could also create conflicts of interest, it warns, with banks' keeping on lending to firms to which they're now tied.  Rising debt levels, especially among businesses, have long been a concern for China's economy. And the issue is closely linked to the government, since many of China's large state-owned enterprises are notoriously inefficient and wasteful.  Beijing has been trying to balance these risks, while shifting the country's growth engine away from the old model of manufacturing and exports toward one led by services and greater consumption.  Related: China plans to cut 1.8 million coal and steel jobs  The IMF report said \"a more ambitious and comprehensive policy agenda is urgently needed to stay ahead of rising financial sector vulnerabilities.\"  It suggested the government should revamp struggling firms that are viable and liquidate those that aren't. Authorities should also require banks to be more proactive in identifying bad loans, it said.  China has already begun to tackle overcapacity at some of these \"zombie\" firms. In late February, Beijing announced that it would cut 1.8 million coal and steel jobs, and also set aside 100 billion yuan ($15.3 billion) over the next two years for unemployment relief, offering training and job placement services.

M is entering a crowded field that includes Apple's (AAPL, Tech30) Siri, Microsoft's (MSFT, Tech30) Cortana, Google (GOOG) Now and Amazon's (AMZN, Tech30) Alexa. Like most of those assistants, M answers the regular questions about things like restaurant recommendations, trivia and weather.  But M is a little different.  First, it doesn't have a voice. You communicate with it using text, just as you would any other private Messenger conversation.  Related: Which is the best digital assistant?  It does many of the things that other assistants cannot. Like Amazon's Echo speakers, M wants to help you spend your money. It can place online orders for things like flowers and book hotels. It communicates more with the outside world, booking appointments or getting through customer service hotlines.  Completing these types of tasks is beyond the scope of current AI technology. To fill the gap, Facebook (FB, Tech30) has real humans working to train and supervise the tool. (It's unclear how big this staff is or how much they participate in individual tasks.)  Startups Magic and Operator have launched similar tools. You text requests to order food, deliver flowers or find a product, and a live operator will make it so.  \"This is early in the journey to build M into an at-scale service. But it's an exciting step toward enabling people on Messenger to get things done across a variety of things,\" said David Marcus, Facebook's VP of Messenger products, in a post announcing the tool.  And then there are the things M can't do.  M doesn't really know you, at least not yet. It's more of a runner than a personal assistant. M is not as involved in your day-to-day life as OS-based assistants like Siri, Cortana and Google Now. Those tools have access to powerful amounts of personal information, like your calendar and commutes, search history, likes and dislikes. M isn't pulling any information from your Facebook account -- all it's using is what's in the conversation thread.

The single letter actually calls to mind another, more powerful Bond character: the head of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service. It's unlikely that M would ever run out and buy your significant other an anniversary gift.  M will start rolling out slowly to other iOS and Android Messenger users in the next few months.
