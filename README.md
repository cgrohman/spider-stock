# spider-stock
The objective of this project is to try to predict the outcome of a stock based on articles/historical performance data. The project flow is roughly as follows:
	1. Deploy scraping spider to identify and gather relevant text articles.
	2. Quantize the article data to reflect the positive and negative sentiment of the text.
	3. Use a genetic algorithm to optimally select a subset of these articles as inputs to a machine learning algorithm.
	4. Use trained machine learning algorithm to attempt to predict the performance of stock

	1. Scraping article data:
	Description of how data scraping and data storage will be handled

	2. Quantize data:
	Description of data model and quantization methods

	3. Genetic Algorithm:
	Description of genetic algorithm methodology

	4. Machine Learnign Algorith:
	Description of possible implementations (NN). Training/testing/scoring descriptions.
