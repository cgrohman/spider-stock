Trump heads up development and acquisitions at The Trump Organization, which has over 20,000 employees. She also has her own clothing and jewelry line.  \"The decisions you make on the hiring front, that's key,\" she said Wednesday at the Forbes Women's Summit in New York. \"The opportunity cost of hiring the wrong person is so enormous.\"  Related: How Jessica Alba built her $1 billion business  When hiring, she said she looks for people who are strong where she isn't.  \"I always say to myself that I shouldn't be doing things that people can be doing better than me,\" she said.  If someone needs to be let go, she said it's important to be disciplined. It's about being kind to the employee while being honest with yourself and the needs of your business.  \"Sometimes it was the right hire for you five years ago and it's not a great hire for you today,\" she said, adding that it often happens when the firm's focus shifts or when the company outgrows the person's skill set.

Once they landed, her brother went in one car and she went in another.  She ended up at a mall. Her brother did not.  Trump said she was told, \"Well, they thought that you would prefer to go shopping while your brother is in the office.\"  She laughed and told the crowd, \"We have a long way to come globally and, obviously, domestically.\" "},

The presidential candidate unloaded his 24th floor place in the Trump Park Avenue building in New York. The 6,200-square-foot unit, number 24, takes up an entire floor and has five bedrooms and 7.5 bathrooms.  The apartment, which Trump never lived in, had been on the market for about a year and half, according to Michelle Griffith, listing agent at Trump International Realty, and had been listed at nearly $25 million.  The all-cash deal closed on Friday to an undisclosed buyer from the U.S., Griffith said. \"It's one of the highest prices per square foot in the building, so Mr. Trump was very excited.\"   Related: Got $25 million?

Trump still owns other units in the building, Griffith said, including penthouse 31/32, which is 6,278 square feet and is listed for sale for $35 million.  The pre-war building has a 24-hour doorman, is close to Central Park and offers daily maid and laundry services.  "}
